            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Sò ben, che dauanti à cosi Grand Principeſſa,
<pb facs="tcp:62666:3"/> dotata di purgatiſſimo giuditio, e di lucidiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi talenti, non dourebbono à comparir ſe non de' più rinomati ingegni l'opere ſcielte florida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente depinte, e non i ruuidi abbozzamenti di ſcrittor dozzinale; mà la Confidanza ch' io tengo nella ſua degneuole bontà mi ſublima à ſperar, che ella ſia non ſolo per compatir alla rozzezza di queſto mal organizzato parto; ma che ſia anco per accettarlo, come oſſequioſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maggio della mia veneratione; con quella pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidezza del uolto ch' è ſua propria: Riguardan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do non alla pouertà della uittima, mà alla Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione del cuor, che mi hà moſſo à farle queſta offerta, inchineuolmente portandola all'Ara del voſtro Nume.</p>
            <p>Gli è vero, che pecco in temerità; e grande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente m' arroſſiſco della picciolezza dell'obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione; ma qual eſſa ſia ſi ella ſi compiacerà di prenderla ingrado, co'l ſolo ſuo compiacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſene, le darà quel merito e luſtro, del quale eſſa ſi troua biſogneuole; adoperando à guiſa del Rè de' Pianeti, che non ſolo indora le cime di monti, e le ſummità di torreggianti palaggi àſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pergendole della luce: ma illuſtra ancor con li ſuoi raggi ſolari le coſe più baſſe e vili.</p>
            <p>Francamente confeſſo, che a farle queſta de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatione, da niun' altra ragione ſono ſtato in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotto,
<pb facs="tcp:62666:3"/> che dal ſolo merito del ſoggetto, che in realtà è vaga, e curioſa; ed oltre di ciò di tanta altezza, che m' è paruto non pur degno della ſua pardonanza; ma etiandio in qualche parte proportionata alla di lei grandezza: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de mi ſeruirebbe d'apologia, per adombrar la colpa del ſouerchio ardir, e per rendermi l'aſſonto perdonabile.</p>
            <p>Ecco Signora Sourana, il Beato Pietro diuien l'Argomento de' miei ragionamenti; e non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teua meglio ſeruir alla di lui ſplendidezza, che con procurargli per Tutrice una Principeſſa; nella chiarezza della naſcita, nella ſublimità del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ſorte, e nella ſingolarità della virtù parimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Eccelſa. Sarebbe indecente all'honor di col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui, chi s' addimanda il Prencipe degli Apoſtoli, ad altri eſſer raccomandato, che alla più emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nente Principeſſa. Ecco a qual ſegno ſono guinte le ſue glorie! il San Pietro, la Pietra Fundamentale della CHIESA: L'USCIER CE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LESTE, chi tien le chiaue del Regno ſtellato: L' Uniuerſale Paſtore della greggia di Chriſto: Il Maggiordomo, il Luogotenente del N.

<pb facs="tcp:62666:4"/> favor, alla ſua protettione, quaſi à ſicura fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chigia recorrendo. Nel ſuo Real Palaggio chiede un cantoncino, da involarſi a' colpi de' nemichi, dalli quali vien berſagliato. Ella ſi degni di gratioſamente raccoglierlo con raggio di luce benigna. Chi sà forſe vien apportator, ò almeno precurſor, di qualche ſegnalata bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dittione, queſto Grand Apoſtolo.</p>
            <p>E bèn vero che è ſtato la ſua diſauventura, che li convien rappreſentar ſele dauanti, ſotto ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito vile &amp; abjetto; il che lo confeſſo è ſtato ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionato dalla mendicità del mio pouero ſtile ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profatto dalla ricchezza della materia.

            <p>In quanto al contenuto del Libro, hò tratta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to di varie coſe, mà più diffuſamente, e con più eſſatto ſquittinio del Primato di S. Pietro: Materia d'importantiſſimo rilievo, concio ſia coſa da queſto articolo mal capito, come da fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda Madre, naſce una numeroſa figlivolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za d'errori: Et à grand ragion gli ſi può dir la
<pb facs="tcp:62666:4"/> radice, e l'originario fonte dello ſciſma Aquilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare: E però è ſtato il mio principale intendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento, con ogni dilucidità riſchiarar queſta ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rità Fundamentale: Impreſa ardua e faticoſa, oue ſi trovano molti groppi da ſcioglier, che a prima uiſta paiono indiſſolubili. Hò etiandio attentato di purgar molti altri dogmi Catolici delle macchie, appoſteli da' nemichi della veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tà; diſuelando di quegli aſtuti truffatori l'arte preſtigioſa. Smaſcherando le loro fallaci ſofiſmi, inorpellate menzogne, e colorite ragioni. Mi ſono anco affaticato in rintuzzar loro l'orgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio, &amp; in otturar la loro lingua defamatoria, con la quale ad ogni potere s' adoprano d'an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerar ci la riputatione, calunniandoci con impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationi maligne &amp; con accuſe inteſſute di falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tà, per renderci odiati al popolazzo. Ma quello che più importa, queſti Maeſtri d'errori im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogliando il ſenſo Germano alla S. Scrittura an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebbiano la luce alla verità: bugiardi predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catori con oratorii incanteſſimi s'impoſſeſſando degli affetti, tradiſcono l'intelletto: Con ſi fatte frodi uccellando la plebe illeterata inſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no maſſime nociue, à tutto ingegno attendendo alla dannoſa agricoltura di ſeminar zizzanie. Quinci naſce, che queſta fiorita Iſola, un tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po beata e gradita al cielo, vien diluviata dall'
<pb facs="tcp:62666:5"/> inondatione ſpauenteuole di ſette; &amp; inſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chita da folte boſcaglie di Hereſie, ortiche, lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole, e tutte le ſorti d'herbaccie, con profon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de radici abbarbicate: Mentre il buon grano de' Catolici dogmi vien ſuffocato da' ſopraſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minati loglii delle Dottrine male ſane. La gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſemplice, coſa ueramente lagrimeuole ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotta dall'ingannevoli impoſture delle loro gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de infide, ſmarrito lo ſentiero dritto, vanno er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando fru ciechi rauuolgimenti d'un laberinto ineſtricabil, teſtardi, orgoglioſi, cervicoſi, &amp; inuaghiti delle loro opinioni erronee; ſenza ſperanza di trouar da' quei giri intricati, l'uſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta: Mentre malamente ammaeſtrati ſparlano, e con ſtomacheuol maledicenza lacerano la fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma della S. Chieſa Catolica, che ſola, à Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bianza di Faro, nel buio del preſente ſecolo con fido lume può inſegnarli, come hanno da in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drizzar la nauigatione ſenza naufragar'. Ma ſopra queſta materia per hora non aggiongerò piu parole.</p>
            <p>Sò bene, che dourei, come e lo ſtile di chi dedica, decantar di U. Maeſtà i pregi, e teſſerle encomii; mà io non ardiſco uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par la fontione di Panegirici; eſſendo li ſuoi vanti maggiori della mia lode, &amp; ella maggior di loro. Io per verità non tengo vocaboli eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſiui,
<pb facs="tcp:62666:5"/> ne parole adeguate all'eminenza delle ſue prerogatiue; onde mi ſembra più meglio con facondo ſilentio ammirar le, che con imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetto ragguaglio minorarle. Ma volendo-le celebrar, non ſaprei donde eſſordir dourei: La ſua Patria, la ſua Famiglia, il ſuo Maritaggio, la ſua Leggiadria, le ſue Virtù eſſendo ugual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente ſublimi.</p>
            <p>Italia, la ſua Culla, &amp; alma Nudrice, è debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice a lei dell'accreſcimento della ſua gloria. La bella Italia, Primo freggio della natura, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza del mondo, e ſimolacro del Cielo: Elet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta dal nume degli Dei per far più chiaro il cielo, e noue ſtelle aggiongere al Fermamento, riuſce più luminoſa, illuſtrata dagli aurei raggi della U. Maeſtà.</p>
            <p>Ella uſcita dalla chiariſſima, &amp; antichiſſima caſa, non ſolo da lei riceue, ma etiandio ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communica ſplendor, auantaggiando la chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezza de' Natali, con l'ingrandimento della For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna, e con le marauiglie delle ſue virtù.

O Donna Diuina fuſte prima Reina di valor, che di nome; ne vi mancaua altro, ch'l titolo: Voi foſte produtta grande, e la voſtra fronte dalla natura fù creata maeſtoſa, ma al noſtro Grand Rè fù riſerbato l'honor à cingerla d'Aurea Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona, il maggior dono de' Dei, ma ſcarſa merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de de' voſtri meriti.</p>
            <p>O Fida Segretaria!

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Am to acquaint you, by way of a ſhort Preface, that the Foundation of this Book was laid ſome Years e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps'd, occaſion'd originally by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of ſome Papers, which paſs'd betwixt a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Divine and my ſelf; which thinking, that he would not ſo ſoon have interrupted (having promis'd me a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Anſwer) I continued my Indagation, not only for my better Information, but likewiſe to qualifie my ſelf for to mould a Reply, in caſe he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with his Promiſe. But hearing no more from him, and finding in me a particular curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:62666:10"/> to penetrate deeper into the knowledge of this important Point, I found it abſolutely neceſſary to conſult with the Fathers (whom my Opponent had in his Papers to me plentifully cited) to avoid the frequent impoſture of falſe imperfect Quotations, and to acquire their true German Senſe; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that thoſe great Luminaries of the Church, could not write, both for, and againſt the ſame thing, but that this their imaginary contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was engender'd, either by the Intereſt, or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or depravity of their Readers picking out here and there ſome words, which might ſeem to countenance their Opinion without weighing the ſcope of the Author, or examining the precedaneous and ſucceeding lines. Having given the Fathers a due Diſcuſſion, I apply'd my ſelf to the Modern Authors of both ſides, and finding them very warm; the one in maintaining, the other in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning this Article, and perceiving their Books larded with Citations out of the ſame Authors, I aſſum'd a Reſolution to find out on which ſide the Cheat lay, and ſo to detect it, well knowing the great importance of this Point, clearly containing the irreverſible Monarchic Government which Chriſt himſelf inſtituted, inveſting St. <hi>Peter</hi> with it, as a platform of Politie, for the ſucceeding Ages of the Church to imitate. From this Model Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
<pb facs="tcp:62666:10"/> have not only revolted; but with opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and reviling Infamations aſperſe and blacken it, not only to make it, and thoſe who ſubmit to it odious to the Populace, but likewiſe, to juſtifie their Schiſmatical Defection from St. <hi>Peters</hi> See.</p>
            <p>Having perus'd the chiefeſt Propugnators of the Proteſtant Party, I found my Opponent had very plentifully glean'd from them, preſenting me as it were with a <hi>Synopſis</hi> of them, which he judging Irrefragrable, made me more deſirous to Probe it: For indeed I had never imbarqu'd my ſelf in ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable an Employ, as to trouble my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſubverting any particular Error he might ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily be found guilty of; but the reaſon that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd me to confute him, was to involve thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of whom he had borrow'd the ſubſtance of his Writings, in his Confutation. So I would not have any one fancy, as if I (guided thereto by ſome Pique,) had whet my Pen againſt one particular Perſon, for I am in perfect Charity with him, and heartily wiſh he may live to ſee his miſtakes in Religion; one may deteſt the Hereſie, and yet at the ſame time affect the Perſon infected with it; according to what St. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> affirms, <hi>De Phocâ,</hi>

            <p>Now as to my writing this Book, I was in a
<pb facs="tcp:62666:11"/> manner enforc'd to Compoſe it; for having former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made ſome imperfect Eſſays on this Subject, which were communicated to others, I found my ſelf now oblig'd to write more compleatly, to prevent that injury to my Name, which poſſibly might have been offer'd after my Death, by their being made publick. What I have here offer'd you, is as well perform'd as my Abilities would permit; ſo I am not aſham'd to own it; and what is here wanting ſhall be ſupply'd in my Second Book. In the interim, I am to beg your candid Cenſure, and Pardon for the imperfections of a Work which was begun ſolely for my private ſatisfaction; but having how finiſh'd it, relying on your Benignity, I divulge it for your benefit: And I ſhall be heartily glad, and think my ſelf ſufficiently rewarded, if it becomes ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you, by confirming you, if a Catholick, or by convincing you, if a Proteſtant: And ſo Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had no ſooner peruſed the Papers you ſent me, but by way of a Letter, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted unto you my Senſe of 'em, and withal, acquainted you, that I would anſwer 'em. But having at that time Imbarqu'd my ſelf in a particular Study, which my Genius warps to with a ſtronger propenſion than to Controverſal Points in Divinity; I could not prevail with my relucting Fancy to relinquiſh it, and reaſſume Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemics, till I had conducted it to a Completion. But I need not make uſe of any excuſive words for this my long ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; matters of ſo high importance as I am now about to handle, ought to be maturely perpended, and not ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on with a hurrying precipitancy. However, if the adjournment of this my rejoynder hath ſeem'd to you too long protracted, I am content to afford you a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd conſideration for your forbearance, which you ſhall find lapp'd up in theſe Papers.</p>
               <p>As for Diſputation, I am not ſo much a forreigner to my ſelf as to be ignorant of its being an imployment, not only diſcordant to my Temper, but ſurmounting my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; requiring a richer Exchequer of Learning than
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62666:14"/> I can pretend to: So I would not have you figure to your ſelf, that I catch at the name of a Diſputant; I yield that Dignity to thoſe whoſe politer Temper, and more embelliſh'd Parts entitle 'em to that Honor. But if my Talent did excell this way, I ſhould very unwillingly grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with ſo topping an Antagoniſt as you are: It might ſeem preſumption in me, who am but a Laic, to enter the Liſt, and take up the Gantlet againſt ſo eminent a Controvertiſt. But that which makes me more backward herein, is my fear (you being <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

And I hope hereby I ſhall not diſguſt any Ingenuous Perſon; for you having anſwered me ſo brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo convincingly, as you fancy'd, I could do no leſs than try whether your, or my Opinion were errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo expiſcate the Truth, which I find not to float on the Surface of the Well, but to dive very deep, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſaying of <hi>Pyrrhon,</hi>

               <p>It will then be my preſent employ to examine thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which I compoſed, both for the Satisfaction and Defence of my Brother, and withal, to bring your Anſwer to a ſtrict Diſquiſition; this is my whole proponiment, my pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aſpiring to no more than what every Chriſtian ought to have, a ſhort Scheme and Diagram of his Religion, which is what St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <hi>every Soul hath in it ſelf the Seed of Divinity.</hi> Now if it ever were neceſſary to poſſeſs ſuch an abridgment of wholeſome Principles, 'tis much more ſo in this humorous, inquiſitive Age, which preſents us with ſo many varieties of falſe Opinions, dreſs'd up in the ſemblance of Truth, that if a diſcerning Circumſpection be not made uſe of, the fallacy may paſs undiſcover'd; and whoever conſiders the vaſt differences amongſt thoſe who are in the attire of Chriſtians, their various and diſcrepant Judgments in Doctrinal Points, and ritual Ceremonies, and with what ardour every Sect endeavours to defend its Opinion, and with what acrimony it oppoſes that of anothers, muſt needs judge it abſolutely neceſſary to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſo much knowledge, as to be able to ſhield himſelf from thoſe many impoſtures which Preſtigiators in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obtrude on credulous Perſons, under the livery of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſound Doctrines.

This ſetting, top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Die, even in Temporals, is pernicious enough, being able to decoct and ruine the moſt flouriſhing Eſtate; but in Eternals, it is far more exitial and deſtructive, as much as Spirituals tranſcend Temporals. It will therefore highly concern every one to guard himſelf from the grand cheat of being impos'd on in matters of Religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering there is ſo much cozenage in the World, to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious what Articles he admits as Sterling, meaſuring his Faith by a ſure Standard; which is the Method I deſign to take in my enſuing Diſcourſe, not devoting my ſelf to any Private Perſons Opinion or Dictates, but ſteering my courſe by the unerring <hi>Pharos</hi> of Antiquity.</p>
               <p>The firſt Objection you make againſt my Treatiſe of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy, is, <hi>That if his Monarchic Power were ſuppos'd, the Biſhop of</hi> Rome<hi>'s Succeſſion in that Dignity</hi>

                  </gap>. <q rend="inline">This is one of the Prerogatives of our City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to have had firſt the Prince of the Apoſtles for its Teacher; for it was no more than fit, that that City in which the name of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> was firſt heard, ſhould receive the firſt Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of the Apoſtles; but when we had him for our Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we did not keep him all his life-time, but we deliver'd him over to the Royal City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This clearly manifeſts his relinquiſhing <hi>Antioch,</hi> and his Tranſmigration to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he ſettled and fixed his <hi>Cathedra,</hi> and concluded his Life by a moſt glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom; ſo that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſucceeded St. <hi>Peter,</hi> dying there, and not the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> (which place he had abandon'd) inherits the Pontificate and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecture of the Univerſal Church, as being his apparent Heir.

               <p>'Tis obſerveable, That when the Fathers deſign to give the true Succeſſion and deſcendency from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as he was the Chriſtian High-Prieſt, they do not enumerate the <hi>Antiochian,</hi> but the <hi>Roman</hi> Succeſſion. Not placing St. <hi>Peter</hi> firſt, then <hi>Evodius</hi> or <hi>Ignatius,</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och;</hi> but firſt St. <hi>Peter,</hi> then <hi>Linus, &amp;c.</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Rome:</hi> Theſe things duly perpended, I could not but wonder how B. <hi>Bramhal</hi> ſhould queſtion how the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> came to be St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Heir, <hi>ex aſſe,</hi> to the Excluſion of his Elder Brother, the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch.

               <p>But now you pretend to give a Reaſon why the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> could not ſucceed St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Dignity, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That ſingular and perſonal Priviledges are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivable to Succeſſors; herein you are certainly right, for <hi>Privilegium perſonale cum perſona moritur;</hi> but then, on the other ſide, you are as much in an Error in fancying what was ſpoken by our Saviour to him, was delivered as to a Private Perſon, and to terminate with him: You had pleas'd me very well had you mention'd what thoſe ſingular Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges were, that were ſo ſolely affix'd to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as not to be inherited by his Succeſſors, <hi>Tu es</hi> Petrus, <hi>&amp; ſuper hanc</hi> Petram, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was none of them, nor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firma Fratres,</hi> nor <hi>Paſce oves meas.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> gives this account of them, <hi>Quaedam dicuntur</hi> Petro <hi>pro ſe tantum, ut vade poſt me Satana, Ter me negabis; quaedam ut uni ex fidelibus, ut ſi peccaverit in te frater; &amp; quaedam pro ſe &amp; Succeſſoribus ratione officii Paſtoralis, ut Paſce oves meas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Paſtoral Privilege conferr'd on him, was not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, but tranſient to his Succeſſors, being granted him as a Publick Perſon, ſo not to expire with him, but to ſurvive in his deſcendents. For the Office of a Paſtor being ordinary, ought to be continued as long as there be Sheep, <hi>Quamdiu permanet ratio inſtitutionis Chriſti, tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu etiam res inſtituta neceſſario permanere debet;</hi> the Paſtorſhip which was inſtituted for the good of the Flock, ought to have an equal duration with it, which is to the conſummation of the World. The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> then lineally deſcending from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> have the ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Authority devolv'd on them by Divine Sanction
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62666:16"/> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> had over the Church, they ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in all thoſe prerogatives which are ordinary and belonging to him (as Supreme Biſhop) for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church; for <hi>eadem Anteceſſoris &amp; Succeſſoris ratio in alicujus maneris obeundi ratione;</hi> ſo that Paſtoral Praefecture which St. <hi>Peter</hi> was inveſted in, after his Death paſſed to his Succeſſor, by him handed to the next, from him tranſmitted to the following, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo by a perpetual deſcendency, embalm'd and convey'd to this preſent Biſhop, as being Ordinary, ſucceſſive and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible; and correſpondently I find <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops having ranked St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Van, under the Title of <hi>Chriſtianorum Pontifex Primus,</hi> to reckon <hi>Linus</hi> for the Second, and the reſt in their order, to <hi>Sylveſter</hi> his <hi>Synchroniſt</hi> the one and thirtieth Pope from St. <hi>Peter;</hi> this Catalogue was continued by St. <hi>Hierom</hi> to <hi>Damaſus</hi> the thirty fifth from St. <hi>Peter.</hi> The Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> then ſucceeding St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Pontificate, are <hi>Jure Succeſſionis,</hi> Heirs to the Sacerdotal Power and Dignities which belonged to St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Sacred Function, as he was <hi>Pontifex Chriſtianorum,</hi> it being but rational, that thoſe Supreme, Pontificial Royalties which St. <hi>Peter</hi> (for the good of the Univerſal Church) was inrob'd in, ſhould ſtill reſide in his Succeſſors for the keeping all ſubordinate Paſtors in their duty, and for the prevention of Schiſm, which will of neceſſity ariſe where there is no Coercive, Compulſory Power to quaſh it. Thus in the Old Law, there was a Sacerdotal Succeſſion of High-Prieſts, and <hi>Aaron</hi> (who was the Head of the Levitical, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the Head of the Chriſtian Hierarchy) was ſucceeded by <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> and he by <hi>Phineas, &amp;c.</hi> and the Authority which <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Children was inveſted with, died not with 'em, but was propagated to the ſucceding High-Prieſts.</p>

               <p>THE next thing you obſerve, and ſeem to miſlike, is my skipping over that part of your Papers which treated of Schiſm. I muſt confeſs, I did decline hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, being unwilling to enter into ſo large a Field of Matter, and ſo I am ſtill; but becauſe you urge, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind me, and ſeem ſo fond of what you wrote on that Point, as to take it ill that I made a Preterition of it, I ſhall now ſupply what I omitted then, for I perceive it is your temper to imagine what I did not anſwer, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable. It cannot but be as pleaſant to hear you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt Schiſm, as to have heard <hi>Verres</hi> inveighing againſt Theft, or the <hi>Gracchi</hi> againſt Sedition. You are pleas'd to call it Damnable Schiſm, the Epithet was very proper, and now look about you, and ſtrictly examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like <hi>David</hi> in his Parly with <hi>Nathan,</hi> you have not through anothers ſide imprudently transfix'd your ſelf, by being found guilty of that Crime you have ſo ſeverely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd in another. I perceive you make uſe of all your Artifice for your compurgation, but all is but fucous and eluſive, your actual Separation having too much evidence to be deny'd, and too much atrocity to be defended.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now, as ſummarily as I can, contract what you write on this Subject, and then ſhape my Reply to it. <q rend="inline">Having defin'd Schiſm to be a voluntary departure from the Catholick Church, you divide it into Paternal and

This you judge ſufficient to clear you from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Schiſm.

That the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, agreed with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all other Churches in her Communion

Both the Time when, and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion why, can be aſſign'd. Moreover, That the firſt Proteſtants were born of Catholick Parents, and Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Communion of the Catholick Church, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, and that they, as deſirous of Innovation volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily departing from that Church, renouncing thoſe points which were Principles of Unity both in Faith and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> became Schiſmaticks, is eaſily prov'd; for <hi>Schiſmaticos non fides diverſa facit, ſed communionis diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupta ſocietas,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Hierom</hi> on <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Now, how <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be guilty of Schiſm, which did never withdraw from any known Chriſtian Society, or depart from the Communion of any former Church, with which before ſhe held Communion, I cannot poſſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; ſhe continu'd fix'd where ſhe was, as the Pillar and Firmament of Truth. All Hereticks, and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks go out of her; this going out, is an antient note of Falſhood, Truth being elder than Error; <hi>They went forth from us,</hi> 1 John 2. 19. <hi>And certain that went from us,</hi> Acts 15. 14. and accordingly St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> 3. <hi>tract. Epiſt. Johan.</hi> ſays, <hi>Omnes Haeretici, omnes Schiſmatici ex nobis exierunt,</hi> i. e. <hi>ex Eccleſia exeunt.</hi> And <hi>de Symb. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Haereſes omnes de Eccleſia exierunt tanquam ſarmenta in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utilia de vite praeciſa; ipſa autem manet in ſua radice.</hi> And in this Caſe the Rule of <hi>Optatus</hi> is very obſervable, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum eſt quis in radice cum toto Orbe manſerit, quis for is exierit,</hi> Lib. primo. Now as for <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> when they had voluntarily departed from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, they ſeparated from all the Chriſtian-Churches in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62666:19"/> World, and conſequently, from the Catholick Church; for they did not adjoyn themſelves in Communion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to any Chriſtian Church which was exiſtent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their revolt from the <hi>Roman,</hi> there being not one Church to be found upon Earth antecedent to their Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to which they did apply themſelves after their defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they ſtood alone till they had acquir'd more Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion; this is moſt clear, and confeſs'd by themſelves. <hi>Luther</hi> in his Preface to King <hi>Henry,</hi> ſays of himſelf, <hi>Solus primo eram;</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> to the ſame effect in his Epiſtle to <hi>Melancthon, Abſurdum eſt poſtquam diſceſſionem a toto orbe facere coacti ſumus inter ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa principia alios ab aliis diſſilire;</hi> So this New Church at the firſt, was but one Perſon, which by the acceſſion of more Schiſmaticks grew numerous, being protected by the Secular againſt the Spiritual Power.</p>
               <p>But to prove your departure from the <hi>Roman</hi> Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be unvoluntary, and conſequently not Schiſmatical, according to your definition of Schiſm, you cite a ſaying which you ſay was King <hi>James</hi>'s, <hi>Non fugimus ſed fuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur;</hi> I muſt confeſs, I never could be inform'd how the truth of theſe Words could be made out; for Proteſtants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Excommunication having made a wilful breach, may be ſaid to be <hi>Fugitivi</hi> rather than <hi>Fugati:</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, their Expulſion may not ſo properly be term'd, a driving them out of the Church, as their Puniſhment for going out, they having before deſerted the Church of their own accord. So ſhe had too much reaſon to make uſe of her Spiritual Weapons; for they, by their Novel Doctrine, and Schiſmatical Separation, having firſt rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from her, and by way of Anti-communion, rais'd a new party of Pretended Reform'd Chriſtians diſtinct from the general Body of the Catholick Church, having inſtituted new Rites, and moulded new Articles of Faith, contrary not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62666:19"/> only to the <hi>Roman,</hi> but to the Faith of all particular Churches then known, immediately before they began their Separation, and refuſing to Communicate and joyn with her in Publick Liturgy, and Participation of Sacraments, diſowning her Faith and Power, to which they had ſubmitted for above 900 Years, and perſiſting obſtinate in their Opinions and Separation, the Church having with much patience attended their return, and having try'd all Methods that might ſeem conducive to their amendment, was enforc'd at laſt to proceed againſt them, according to her Canons by a juſt Excommunication, eliminating them from her Boſom for their Schiſm, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous <hi>Corinthian</hi> for his Inceſt, who by the heinous offence gave the firſt cauſe of his Exciſion: So 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the orignal departure was theirs, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Comments, Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> avers, <hi>Haeretici in ſemetipſos ſententiam dicunt ſuo arbitrio ab Eccleſia recedendo.</hi> And <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Fortieth Epiſtle, <hi>Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas quas meruerunt pependerent, ut a nobis non ejecti ultro ſe ejicerent &amp; de Eccleſiâ ſe expellerent:</hi> For the Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes no Perſon, neither doth ſhe eject any, but like a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mother, cheriſhes her Children in her Vital and Fotive Breaſt, unleſs ſuch as wilfully ſeparate themſelves by their obſtinate adheſion to Heretical Doctrines, or by perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in a Flagitious courſe of Life; ſo as ſhe is not now the hindrance of their Reunion, ſo neither was ſhe at firſt the occaſion of their Separtion.</p>
               <p>Proteſtants well knowing, that their formal Schiſm can neither be deny'd, nor maintain'd; find themſelves oblig'd to acknowledge the Matter of Fact, but to blanch and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy their Crime, pretend to have had a juſt Cauſe given them for their Separation; and upon this ſuppoſition accuſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of cauſal Schiſm. This is what I conceive Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> to mean, when he ſays, <hi>The</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62666:20"/> 
                  <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>impoſing unlawful Conditions of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was neceſſary not to Communicate with her.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Lawd</hi> is very clear herein, <hi>The cauſe of Schiſm is yours,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for you thruſt us from you, becauſe we call'd for Truth and Redreſs of Abuſes.</hi> As for Abuſes, if any were crept in, they ought to have been redreſs'd; and this is properly Reformation; but to alter receiv'd Articles of Faith eſtabliſh'd by Councils, that is Hereſie. But I could not be ſatisfied what truth it was, that the Biſhop ſays, they call'd for: I am fully convinc'd, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church did retain as a faithful depoſitary, all thoſe Sacred Truths which <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great convey'd unto us by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who I do fully believe did convert this Nation to the true Faith, eſtabliſhing his Doctrine with Miracles, which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ſtill preſerv'd unſtain'd by the Catholicks of this Kingdom. So I could not underſtand what the Biſhop meant by calling for Truth, neither could I tell when, or by whom it was call'd; for I muſt confeſs, <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who open'd the Sluces to let in all the enſuing Miſchief, did call, and that Vocally, but not for Truth: His firſt call was for a freſh Bedfellow, that was Carnal; then he call'd for innocent Blood, that was Tyrannical; his other call was for Church-Goods and Lands, that was a Sacrilegious call; he had no ſcruples concerning the truth of his Religion, neither alter'd he any thing of it, but to gratifie his Luſt and Covetouſneſs, <hi>Nullâ fere in re a fide Catholica diſceſſit, praeterquam libidinis &amp; luxuriae causâ,</hi> as <hi>Sanders</hi> affirms of him: And accordingly he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Son to be brought up in the Catholick Religion, excepting the Title of <hi>Head of the Church. Edward</hi> the Sixth was too young to call for Truth; he had moſt reaſon to call for it, being early infected with the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, contrary to his Fathers Will, by the Sacrilegious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62666:20"/> Protector, who did call indeed, but it was for the remains of the Goods of the Impoveriſh'd Church; he likewiſe call'd for falſe Teachers to dilate the Gangren: <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> a <hi>Dominican, Peter Martyr</hi> a <hi>Canon-Regular, Ochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> Apoſtate Monks and <hi>Sacerdotes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xorati,</hi> from ſuch we were not like to have Truth, who, not only fell from the Catholick Church, but flagitiouſly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated their Oath of Continency, for which, by the then eſtabliſh'd Law, they lay obnoxious to an infamous Death. I ſhall ſay nothing of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſhe being a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and wholly unqualified to meddle with Church Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and to tamper in Articles of Faith; neither ſhall I ſay any thing of the ſucceeding Princes, who found the Schiſm begun, and Religion alter'd to their Hands. I know very well, that in this caſe Truth is the Pretext, but that is no more than what is in the Mouth of every Sectary: This is the uſual Mask to hide the ugly Face of a foul Action, which without ſo fine a cover would affright thoſe delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Souls that are cheated with its beatiful Paint, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, there muſt be a plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble glittering Title, a winning Frontiſpiece to a bad En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; but if the Origine of this unhappy Schiſm be examin'd, we ſhall find that Revenge, Haughtineſs, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Flames, and deſire of Plunder were the Springs that mov'd the firſt Machin, and nothing at all of Truth. I do not find, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth did ever recant the Book, he writ in defence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; he hated both <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> and <hi>Zuinglianiſm,</hi> and fell out with the Church, rather for its Booty and Prey, than for its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and this was <hi>Tyndals</hi> Senſe of it in his Letter to <hi>Frith,</hi> where writing of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Pope and Clergy, ſaith thus, <hi>Fox</hi> pag. 987. <hi>I ſmell a Council to be taken, little for the Clergies profit in time to come, but you muſt underſtand, that it is not</hi>

                  <hi>out of pure Heart, and for love of Truth, but to avenge himſelf, and to eat the Whores Fleſh, and drink the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of her Bones, which becauſe 'tis ſomewhat enigmatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſs'd,</hi> Fox <hi>is pleas'd in the Margent thus to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; eating the Whores Fleſh, is to ſpoyl the Popes Church only for the Prey and Spoyl thereof, not Religion.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> is very honeſt herein, <hi>As for the ſuppreſſion of Monaſteries</hi> (ſays he) <hi>we fear that covetouſneſs had a great Oar in the Boat; and that ſundry of the Principal Actors had a greater aim at the Goods of the Church than at the good of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having premis'd thus much, I ſhall now take notice how you acquit your Church of Schiſm, even according to your own Diſtinction and Diviſion of it: You ſay ſhe is not guilty of that Crime, <hi>becauſe ſhe owns and performs Obedience to Chriſt and his Apoſtles; Then, becauſe ſhe pays Reverence to the Antient Fathers of the Church:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe ſhe owns the firſt four General Councils,</hi> &amp;c. This you think enough to clear her of Schiſm, whereas 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to the purpoſe, being a meer <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and beſides the Cuſhion; you define Paternal Schiſm to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation of Obedience and Communion to and with our Eccleſiaſtick Governours, ſo how do any of theſe Reaſons clear you of it? You are accus'd by Catholicks, of a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry departure out of the Catholick Church, of a defection from the Government of your Occidental Patriarch, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Spiritual Prefecture this Nation was for ſeveral hundred Years. From this your Spiritual Governor you have revolted, renouncing his Authority, look'd on as of Divine Inſtitution; this being your Accuſation, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alledg'd for your acquittance are too weak and dilute for ſuch a purpoſe. Now, tho' you come off with a ſcratch'd Face concerning your Paternal, I muſt needs ſay, you come off very fairly with your Fraternal Schiſm,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62666:21"/> 
                  <hi>becauſe you ſo courteouſly give the Right-hand of Fellowſhip to ſo many Churches;</hi> and herein your obliging carriage is highly to be commended, you extending your kindneſs to <hi>Lutheran, Calveniſt</hi> or <hi>Hugonot;</hi> and indeed, to any Church that will but joyn with you in ſeparating from, and defaming the Catholick.</p>
               <p>The next thing I have to do, is to ſee how you prove <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of Schiſm; and the Method you take herein, I found to be as improper as that by which you would clear your own Church of it. For inſtead of proving <hi>Rome</hi> ſeparating it ſelf from any viſible Society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians with whom ſhe formerly held Communion, which is properly Schiſm, you accuſe her of falſe Doctrine; which Accuſation, could you be able to make good, it would prove her to be rather Erroneous than Schiſmatical.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall now deſcend to the Examination of thoſe three Particulars, by which you would prove your ſelf not guilty of Schiſm. The firſt is <hi>becauſe you own, and perform Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and obſerve all the Rules and Ordinances they have left you in the Scriptures.</hi> But how you can pretend to pay full Obedience to Chriſt, and diſobey his Spouſe whom he enjoyns you to hear under penalty of being reputed an <hi>Ethnick;</hi> or how you can fancy to be united to him, when you fall off from his Myſtical Body, the Church, of which he is the Head, I know not; or how you can be ſaid to follow all the Rules of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when they recommend Tradition, and you reject it; when they tell you, that the Church is the Pillar and Firmament of Truth, and you make her Apoſtatical. I could inſtance in many particulars, how counter you run to the Scripture you ſo much pretend to, but I ſhall wave them, and only tell you, that it is an unwarrantable way to fall off from the Church, and then appeal to that Scripture which commands you to obey the Church; yet
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62666:22"/> this is your practice, when you diſpute with Catholicks; but when you have to do with Sectaries, who plead Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt you, then you have recourſe to Fathers, and Tradition, uſing the ſame Arguments againſt them as we do againſt you.</p>
               <p>It was long ago obſerv'd by the Fathers, That Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks were great pretenders to the Scriptures, backing their falſe Opinions with it. <hi>Omnes Haeretici ex ſacris Scripturis falſas atque fallaces Opiniones ſuas conantur de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendere,</hi> as <hi>Hilarius</hi> atteſts <hi>Lib. prim. de Trint. &amp; Vincent. Lyrinenſis,</hi> to the ſame effect, <hi>Nihil de ſuo proferunt quod non Scripturarum verbis adumbrare conentur.</hi> This they formerly did, and ſtill do, to reject the Authority of the Church, and to avoid a living Judge they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Scripture; then they aſſume to themſelves what they deny the Church, it's Expoſition, perverting it's true Senſe according to their wild Fancies, and ſo crooken the Rule to their own Bent: This was obſerv'd by St. <hi>Baſil Hexam. Hom.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>Theſe falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers of Truth which do not teach their mind to follow the Scripture, but contort the meaning of Divine Writ to their own Wills.</hi> Now tho' the Scripture, as being the Word of God, is infallibly true, yet it do's witneſs of it ſelf, that it is not of private Interpretation, and thoſe that dare Expound it that way, may inſtead of ſound Truths, extract damnable Doctrines. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> avouches, That all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies take their Birth from its wrong Interpretation, in his 222 Epiſtle to <hi>Conſentius, Neque enim natae ſunt Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſes niſi dum Scripturae bonae intelliguntur non bene:</hi> To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this, we muſt not Interpret them according to our Fancies, but adhere to the Interpretations of the Church, not at all queſtioning, but that that Spirit of Truth which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62666:22"/> did direct it, to diſtinguiſh Canonical from Adulterine Writ, will likewiſe inſtruct it in the right Interpretation: And herein conſiſts the difference betwixt Catholicks and Hereticks, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves, <hi>Libro de Gratia. Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici ſecundum ſuum ſenſum Sacras Scripturas legunt;</hi> but we according to Antiquity and conſtant Tradition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving both the Scripture, and its Senſe from the Church; and her Authority is ſo conſiderable herein, that St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin. Epiſt. Manich.</hi> ſays, <hi>Ego Evangelio non crederem, niſi me Catholicae Eccleſiae commoveret authoritas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second Reaſon, <hi>is becauſe you pay Reverence to the Antient Fathers of the Church.</hi> Of this I ſhall hereafter have occaſion to take notice, and likewiſe of your Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and Integrity in quoting them.</p>
               <p>The Third Reaſon to acquit your ſelf of Schiſm, is, <hi>becauſe you own the firſt four General Councils, and are willing that the difference betwixt you and other Churches ſhould be decided by their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpirage;</hi> but I muſt tell you, That if you own'd Forty Councils inſtead of Four, and revolted from the Church, that would not diſcharge you of the Crime of Schiſm: As for your pretended willingneſs to admit them as Judges in differences betwixt you and other Churches, this will appear to be a very empty Compliment, unleſs you can prove, that they made Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions concerning our Modern Controverſies; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd to define about the Hereſies riſe in thoſe days of the <hi>Arrians, Neſtorians, Eutychians, Macedonians,</hi> not concerning thoſe of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> a word not then known, and had their Doctrines been then extant, they would as certainly have been condemned as the foregoing: I ſhall only inſtance in one point, in one Council, that of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon;</hi> I am fully convinc'd, that that Council which paid ſo much reſpect to Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> acknowledging him to have receiv'd the cuſtody of the Vineyard from Chriſt,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62666:23"/> granting him, when they ſent their Relation to him to preſide over them, by vertue of his Legate, as the Head do's over the Members, would have ſeverely ſentenc'd your revolt from that See. That Council (which depos'd <hi>Dioſcurus</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and conſequently no Subject of <hi>Leo</hi>'s, as he was Patriarch of the <hi>Weſt;</hi> not for any Erroneous Doctrine, but for his Sawcineſs againſt him, whom they call his <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Lord; and becauſe he dar'd to convene a Synod without leave from the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick See) would moſt certainly have condemn'd your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ftom the Authority of your Occidental Patriarch, and more, your Opprobrious Revilings of him. But why the firſt four General Councils? why not a Stage farther? why <hi>Hic Terminus haeret?</hi> Can you prove that all Conteſts in Matters of Faith, ariſing in future Ages, and in much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Centuries could poſſibly be determin'd in thoſe Councils? Would you have an Hereſie be condem'd before it be broach'd? your referring all our Controverſal Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to their Deciſion, is as irrational as if <hi>Macedonius,</hi> who was condemn'd concerning his Hereſie about the Holy Ghoſt in the Second General Council, had appeal'd to the <hi>Nicene,</hi> which aſſembled chiefly to confute the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of <hi>Arrius</hi> concerning God the Son, and determin'd nothing about the Third Perſon of the Trinity: Beſides, I know no reaſon why the Church ſhould be credited in the firſt four General Councils, and ſlighted and disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd in the following; Chriſt promis'd he would be with them to the conſummation of the World; I do not in the leaſt queſtion, but that the ſame Spirit of Truth which guided and directed the Church in its firſt Synods, did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it in all its ſucceeding Conventions, rendring it inerrable in its Definitions of Faith. I can find no place where Chriſt promis'd to be with them for a limited time, ſo as to direct them in their firſt four Aſſemblies, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62666:23"/> to leave them for the future to themſelves: It would have been a great incouragement to all new Hereſies, if no Deciſion in Gods Church ſhould have been after the firſt four General Councils. The truth of it is this, 'Tis uſual with Hereticks to be Enemies to thoſe Councils, and to reject them that have condemn'd their Opinions, charging them with Error as the <hi>Arrians</hi> did that of <hi>Nicene;</hi> the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> that of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> the <hi>Eutichians</hi> that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Emperor <hi>Zeno</hi> being an <hi>Eutychian,</hi> having put out a Profeſſion of Faith, which he call'd <hi>Henoticon;</hi> he left out the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which had condemn'd that Error, embracing only the Faith of the three firſt Councils.</p>
               <p>The next thing I ſhall Diſcourſe of, will be concerning your Church which you aſſert to have all the Eſſentials of a true Church, and to be a ſound part of the Catholick; This I wiſh you had prov'd as manifeſtly as you confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm it: Had you done this, I would never have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken its Communion. You cannot but imagine it to be a very hard task for any to forſake his Relations, his Friends, his Countrey-men in Matters of Religion, and thereby to expoſe himſelf to their Odium, the ſeverity of rigid Laws, and his Temporal Concerns to ruine; nothing but the ſaving of ones Soul can be preponderant to all theſe Miſchiefs. So you may conceive, that had I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd my ſelf as ſafe, in reference to my Salvation in your Church, as where I now am, I had moſt certainly fix'd my ſelf there, <hi>Clavo Trabali.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to your aſſerting <hi>your Church to have all the Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of a true one,</hi> I muſt tell you plainly this, That I find in the Fathers, many to be condemn'd for Hereticks, for denying but one of thoſe many Articles which you diſown: But as for Eſſentials, and Fundamentals, I know you pretend to them, but I cannot ſee where your Authors define how many they be, but leave them uncertain for their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62666:24"/> As to the other branch of the Aſſertion, <hi>That your Church is a ſound part of the Catholick Church;</hi> I muſt beg your Aſſiſtance herein, to inform me how a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, that did voluntarily fall off from the Catholick, as yours did, and afterward was cut off by Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from it, can yet continue to be a ſound Member of it; this I deſire you to clear up to me. You muſt not ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle with me herein, and tell me ye did not fall off from it, but from its Errors; that's ridiculous: Neither that ye did not fall off from the Catholick, but only from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; that is falſe; for ye then broke Communion from all Viſible, Orthodox Churches, both in the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>Eaſt:</hi> According to my Authors, ſuch Churches as yours can be no more Members of the Catholick Church, than a dead Bough may be term'd part of that Tree from which 'tis ſeparated by Exciſion.

Now tho' theſe be oppoſite Parties, of different Principles, yet to enlarge their bounds, and to boaſt of

               <p>But now, after all this, I find, that neither Schiſm nor Hereſie, according to the Senſe of your Party, hinders one from being a Member of the Church.

               <head>CHAP. III. Concerning the Reſpect which Catholicks pay to Images.</head>
               <p>I Shall next employ my ſelf in taking a Proſpect of thoſe Points, for maintaining which, you would prove <hi>Rome</hi> notoriouſly guilty of Paternal Schiſm; and this I do the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62666:27"/> more willingly, becauſe you ſtand highly guilty of a falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting them. The Firſt is Image-Worſhip (as you phraſe it) which you have improv'd, and ſublimated to that height as to make it paſs for Idolatry: This is done to render your ſelves acceptable, and us odious to the Populace, as Violators of the firſt Commandment. 'Tis but rendring <hi>Peſel</hi> (which properly ſignifies <hi>Sculptile)</hi> to be an Image, and then boldly affirming us Idolators; to bring all the places in Scripture and Fathers againſt the Idolatry of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the buſineſs is done: But thoſe places are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing to your purpoſe, they only importing a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of giving Soveraign Honor due to God, to an Idol; whereas you are to prove out of Scripture, That 'tis unlawful to give a Relative Honor to the Picture of Chriſt for his ſake: But by this Action, you do not only ſhew your ſelf defamatory, but ungrateful to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which, when this Nation lay really in the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Idolatry, took compaſſion of us, and by plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel here, reſcu'd us from that Calamitous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. This confounding Image-worſhip with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is certainly, a moſt fraudulent and malitious Method, they being quite different things; the one is an Honorary, Relative Reſpect to the thing repreſented, which is Sacred: But the other is a Worſhipping a Creature, an Idol, a Devil, or falſe God, in ſome dark Repreſentation, giving it Divine, Incommunicable Attributes, and in the Imagination exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing ſupreme Devotion to it; for to thoſe Idols, by Magical Conjuration they annexed an Evil Spirit to do Wonders, and thereby to extort Divine Worſhip from the cheated People; hence they are often call'd Gods; as in the Fifth of <hi>Daniel</hi> they pray'd their Gods of Silver, Braſs, Iron, Wood, Stone. Now to aſcribe this heinous Sin to the Catholick Church is highly injurious, Idolatry being the blackeſt Sin a Church can be ſpotted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62666:27"/> with; for it doth not only thereby ceaſe to be a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, but it becomes worſe than a Jewiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; and I had rather turn <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Turk</hi> than Idolater. There is no Queſtion, but that Idolatry is a ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for any one to fall off from a Church that is tainted with it: But if this were the reaſon of your falling off from <hi>Rome,</hi> the pretence was malicious and forg'd; and Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> who well knew what Idolatry was, will tell you in his <hi>Juſt weight, Cap. primo,</hi> his Opinion herein, whoſe words are theſe, <hi>Should the Church of</hi> England <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the change, which we call Reformation, is grounded upon this ſuppoſition, I muſt then acknowledge that we are Schiſmaticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I ſhall now make a ſhort Diſcuſſion of this Point, according to the Definition of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which I find to take all care imaginable to obviate any accuſation herein; the Words being as ſo many Characters, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the reſpect paid to an Image, from Idolatry. Firſt, the Council thinks fit, <hi>Imagines Chriſti Deiparae Virginis &amp; aliorum Sanctorum in Templis praeſertim habendas &amp; retinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das eiſque debitum honorem &amp; venerationem impertiendam;</hi> but then by diſclaiming any Divinity to be in them, the Council acquits us of Idolatry in the following words, <hi>Non quod credatur ineſſe aliqua in iis divinitas vel virtus propter quam ſint colendae, vel quod ab eis ſit aliquid petendum, vel quod fiducia in imaginibus ſit habenda veluti olim fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat a gentibus quae in idolis ſpem ſuam collocabant; ſed quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam honos qui eis exhibetur refertur ad prototypa quae illa repraeſentant,</hi> &amp;c. Now as to the firſt part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil concerning retaining Images in Churches, this was antiently practis'd long before that Council. <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> in his Forty ninth Epiſtle to <hi>Olymp.</hi> makes mention of Images in the Church of <hi>Dioceſarea. Baſil</hi> in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Barlaam</hi> pointeth to his Image which ſtood in the

                  </gap>, <hi>ſome pleaſant and flowry Meadows. Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> affirms, that <hi>Pulcheria</hi> the Empreſs built a Church at <hi>Conſtant.</hi> and placed therein a Picture of our Bleſſed Lady, which <hi>Eudocia</hi> ſent her from <hi>Hieruſalem. Tertull.</hi> in his Second Book <hi>de Pudicitia,</hi> witneſſeth, that the Image of Chriſt in form of a Shepherd, carrying a Sheep on his Shoulders, was engraven on the <hi>Chalices</hi> uſed in the Church. <hi>Auguſt. de conſenſ. Evang.</hi> witneſſeth, that in his time Chriſt was to be ſeen in many places painted between St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul. Euſebius</hi> in his Seventh Book of his <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſ.</hi> Hiſtory, makes mention of a Brazen Statue of Chriſt at <hi>Caeſarea Philippi,</hi> thought to be erected by the <hi>Haemaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſa,</hi> cur'd by him; this Statue he declares to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to his days, and that he had ſeen it. <hi>Sozomen</hi> adds, That when <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate out of ſpight againſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, caus'd it to be caſt down, and his own ſet up in the place, that there came miraculouſly Fire from Heaven which conſum'd <hi>Julians;</hi> Chriſt by this avenging the affront offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Statue by that Inſolent Apoſtate, as much as if it had been done to his Perſon: And the ſame Author tells us, That when Chriſts Image was thrown down, and broken in pieces, the Chriſtians gathered up its fragments, and laid them up in the Church, which certainly was in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to the Prototype.</p>
               <p>The other part of the words of the Council is, <hi>That thoſe Images ſhould have their due Honor and Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> It cannot be deny'd but that an Image is capable of Honor, and of Contempt; and it naturally flows, that thoſe that hate the Party repreſented by the Picture, will hate the Picture; and thoſe that love the Party, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Picture. Now this reſpect which Catholicks out of love to the Perſons repreſented by them, have for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62666:28"/> Pictures, is very ſlanderouſly call'd by you Idolatry; whereas that conſiſts in forſaking the true God, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping either real Devils, or falſe Gods; ſo thoſe Idols ſtood in oppoſition to the true God, as 'tis. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 21. <hi>If the Lord be God, follow him; but if</hi> Baal <hi>be God, follow him.</hi> And 'tis well known, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> as often as they fell to Idolatry, always forſook the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Then the Council gives the Reaſon why they ſhould be Honour'd. <hi>Quoniam honos qui eis exhibetur, refertur ad Prototypum.</hi> This is exactly what St. <hi>Baſil</hi> affirms, <hi>de Spiritu Sancto,</hi>

A Civil Honor is due to the Picture of a King of our Anceſtors, and nigh Relations, and to thoſe we love. We reſent any ignominy offered them, and naturally conceive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation thereat. A Religious Honor is due to the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of Chriſt, his Holy Apoſtles and Saints; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſhewn them redounding to the Original, and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately terminating on it, as 'tis in the Second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, Act 7. <hi>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62666:29"/> Avdacious Spirit, and Impudent Mouth, was the firſt that dar'd to affirm, That the Image of Chriſt and of the Saints were not to be reverenc'd. Now when the word <hi>Worſhip</hi> or <hi>Adoration</hi> is apply'd, it do's really amount to no more than an honorary Reſpect and Reverence, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, Inferior Honor: We do not take thoſe words in that Senſe, as the Tribute of Honor due to God, as you injuriouſly aſperſe us with, this we abhor; for in that Senſe we Adore and Worſhip only the incomprehenſible Deity, that Supreme Monarch who has Sovereign Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over all, renouncing all other Divine Adoration.</p>
               <p>Now, as to the word <hi>Adoration</hi> (of which you make great advantage againſt us with the Communalty) you muſt underſtand, that it do's not always ſignify Divine or Religious Worſhip, but it has likewiſe an inferiour Senſe, importing Reverence, Reſpect either of Body or Mind, communicable to Creatures according to their Dignities; ſometimes any bowing the Body in ſign of Reverence, as may be proved by many places in Scripture, where Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſaid to be ador'd; and ſo to Deſerving, Eminent, Worſhipful Men, we may be ſaid to give Worſhip, when we Honor and Reſpect them by bowing, or by any other outward geſture, according to the cuſtom of the Countrey.</p>
               <p>Now, as to the Act of worſhip, that conſiſts of two Parts; the Exterior ſign is Kneeling, the Interior is the Affection directed to what we Worſhip; and indeed, that is the main thing; for as to the Exterior, that we grant to Perſons of ſeveral qualities (as well as to God) as to our King, our Biſhop, and Parents; but this is done with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Apprehenſions and Affections; we worſhip God as our Creator in a more ſublime and eminent manner; others in a lower degree.

               <p>Now, as I do undoubtedly believe, that (when Chriſt ſpake theſe words) they had their effect as ſoon as they were uttered, and for this I have St. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> Authority, who affirms, That Chriſt, when he ſaid <hi>this is my Body,</hi> made it his Body: So with the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I do believe, when a lawful Prieſt of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church pronounces the ſame Conſecratory words, that they have the ſame effect. <hi>Sacra ipſa oblatio, ſive il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> Petrus <hi>ſive</hi> Paulus, <hi>ſive cujuſvis meriti ſacerdos offerat, eadem eſt quam dedit Chriſtus Diſcipulis; quamque ſacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes modo conficiunt nihil habet iſta quam illa minus: cur id? quia non ſanctificant homines, ſed Chriſtus qui illam an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea ſacraverat,</hi> in his 2. <hi>Hom.</hi> on 2 Epiſt. <hi>Timothy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know this Doctrine is much oppos'd by our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and they fancy that we are ſufficiently confuted by having it try'd at the Tribunal of our Senſes; but this is not at all prevalent with me; for Chriſt never intended, that this ſupernatural change ſhould be ſubjected to our External Senſes; for had it been viſible to them, it could not have been matter of Faith, which is properly <hi>argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum rerum non apparentium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that Chriſt, before he wrought this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Miracle, had done many viſible ones, to convince his Diſciples of his Divine Power; they having imbibed that belief, could never rationally doubt of his Veracity, or Ability in performance of what he had ſaid, knowing him to be Omnipotent: <hi>Ipſe Dominus teſtificatur nobis</hi>

The Body of Chriſt here is Spiritual not Senſual, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> avers of our Bodies after the Reſurrection; <hi>'tis ſown a Senſual Body, but riſen a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Body:</hi> The Quality of theſe Bodies are different in reference to Clarity, Agility, and Impaſſibility, but the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance periſheth not (which made <hi>Job</hi> ſay, <hi>he ſhould ſee God with theſe Eyes:)</hi> Thus the latter <hi>Adam</hi> is call'd <hi>A quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit,</hi> and as ſuch, he is really in the Sacrament: So that, in fine, this <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <head>CHAP. V. Of Communion in one kind.</head>
               <p>THe third Point by which you would prove the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church guilty of Schiſm, is Communion in one kind. This is generally term'd by you and yours, but an half Communion, and a Violation of Chriſts Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and we are herein accus'd by you, as Sacrilegious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, Injurious to Men, Robbing the Church of Chriſts precious Blood, by giving the People a lame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Sacrament, inſtead of an entire, whole one: This Accuſation runs very high, but I will ſee how juſt it is.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt did inſtitute the Bleſſed Sacrament in both kinds, is readily granted; but that he commanded it ſhould be always taken in both kinds, as neceſſary to the complement of it, is no where to be found; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, in this caſe, we have the example of Chriſt himſelf, who is a ſufficient warrant, for he having in his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtituted it under both kinds, gave it to his Diſciples at <hi>Emaus, Luke</hi> 24. but under one, where the Text ſays, That <hi>they knew Jeſus in breaking of Bread:</hi> Here is no mention of Wine at all, but of Bread only; and this place is Interpreted by the Fathers, of the Adminiſtration of the Bleſſed Euchariſt. <hi>Auguſt. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de conſenſu Evang.</hi> ſays, Chriſt did permit they ſhould not know him, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſque ad Sacramentum Panis.</hi> And <hi>Theoph.</hi> on that place ſays, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>The Eyes of thoſe that did partake of Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62666:35"/> 
                  <hi>Bread were open'd ſo as to know him; for the Fleſh of our Lord has great and unſpeakable Power.</hi> This was likewiſe originally practis'd by the Apoſtles. In the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the <hi>Acts</hi> we find, that the 3000 Baptiz'd were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, and in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of breaking Bread: Here likewiſe is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Wine. And in the Twentieth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> we find, at <hi>Troas,</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> made his long Harangue, <hi>that the Apoſtles were gathered together on the firſt day of the Week to break Bread:</hi> Here is likewiſe a deep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Cup. This breaking of the Bread is likewiſe Interpreted by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> of the Sacrament, in his Epiſt. 86. <hi>ad Caſulanum,</hi> where ſpeaking of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Eadem Nocte fracturus Panem ſicut frangitur in Sacramento Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Chriſti, produxit ſermonem ad medium Noctis, ut poſt Sacramenta celebrata,</hi> &amp;c. Thus 'tis apparent, that tho' Chriſt did Inſtitute it in both kinds, it was no violation of this his Conſtitution to Miniſter it in one; for this there be Preſidents in the ſame Scripture which mentions both Species.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is, whether Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication under one kind be an Imperfect, Lame Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? Herein, upon conſulting the Holy Writ, I find as much aſcrib'd to one kind as to both; ſometimes it attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting Salvation to the Bread and Wine, ſometimes to the Bread only: Thus in the Sixth of <hi>John,</hi> the ſame Chriſt, who ſays, <hi>Niſi manducaveritis Carnem filii hominis, &amp; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beritis ejus Sanguinem, non habebitis vitam in vobis,</hi> ſays likewiſe in the ſame Chapter as much of the Bread alone. <hi>Si quis manducaverit ex hoc Pane, vivet in aeternum.</hi> He that ſays, <hi>Qui manducat meam Carnem, &amp; bibit meum Sanguinem, habet vitam aeternam,</hi> ſays of the Bread only, <hi>Panis quem ego dabo, Caro mea eſt pro mundi ſalute.</hi> He that ſays, <hi>Qui manducat meam Carnem, &amp; bibit meum</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:62666:35"/> 
                  <hi>Sanguinem, in me manet, &amp; ego in illo,</hi> ſays likewiſe, <hi>Qui manducat hunc Panem, vivet in aeternum:</hi> By theſe places it is evident, that Chriſt aſcribes to the Bread alone ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life and Salvation of the World, which is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proof, that it is no imperfect Communion, no Soul deſiring more than that: It remains then, that it appears not by the Scripture, that the reception of Chriſt under the Species of Bread only, is a Defective, Incompleat Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it being viſible from thence, that Chriſt, who gave the Sacrament but twice, gave it in one of thoſe two times in Bread only; and the Apoſtles after him are found to Communicate without any mention of Wine.</p>
               <p>From the Scripture I ſhall have recourſe to Councils for my fuller ſatisfaction (they being the moſt fit Interpreters of it.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Totus Chriſtus continetur ſub ſpecie Panis, &amp; totus ſub ſpecie Vini, ſub qualibet quoque parte conſecratae hoſtiae, &amp; Vini conſecrati ſeparatione facta totus eſt Chriſtus;</hi> ſays the great Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> as well as of thoſe Biſhops of the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firmiſſime credendum ſit, &amp; nullatenus dubitandum, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrum Chriſti Corpus &amp; Sanguinem, tam ſub ſpecie Panis, quam ſub ſpecie Vini veraciter contineri. Conſilium</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanſ. Seſſ. 13.</p>

               <p>And accordingly the Council of <hi>Trent, Seſſ.</hi> 21. ſays: <hi>Sub alterâ tantum ſpecie totum atque integrum Chriſtum verumque Sacramentum ſumi veriſſimum eſt tantum ſub al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terutrâ ſpecie atque ſub utraque contineri;</hi> and in <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Totus enim, &amp; integer Chriſtus ſub ſpecie Panis, &amp; ſub quavis ſpeciei parte, totus item ſub Vini ſpecie, &amp; ſub ejus partibus exiſtit.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62666:36"/>
               <p>The Church is very clear in expreſſing her Senſe herein, by the Mouth of theſe unanimous Councils; declaring, that in one kind is contain'd the whole Subſtance, Eſſence, and Parts of the Sacrament, either part having <hi>Chriſtum totum &amp; integrum, ſecundum Divinam humanamque naturam;</hi> for Bread and Wine are not the two integral parts of the Sacrament, our Savior inſtituting the whole Sacrament both in Bread and Wine, as two diſtinct, entire matters, not as integral parts thereof; ſo the Fleſh cannot be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated without the concomitance of the Blood, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not disjoyn'd from it; neither can the Blood be taken apart without the Body, that being contained in it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be a participation of either without the Soul and Divinity, by reaſon of the inſeparable Hypoſtatick U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>The next thing I ſhall conſider, is, whether the Laity be by any Divine Precept, Commanded to participate of the Cup. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> determinates it in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Nullo Divino Praecepto Laicos &amp; Clericos non conficientes obligari ad Euchariſtiae Sacramentum ſub utrâque ſpecie ſumendum:</hi> Here they likewiſe exempt <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricos non conficientes,</hi> from that obligation which I find to be according to the Council of <hi>Baſil.

                  </gap>, <hi>the Incruentum Sacrificium upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> which is a Commemoration and Repreſentation of that ought to be perform'd by a diſtinction of Symbols, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only a Sacrament, but a Commemorative Sacrifice repreſentative of the Bloody Paſſion.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62666:36"/>
               <p>The following matter to be weigh'd, is whether the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be injur'd or robb'd of any thing hereby: The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſays no. <hi>Nulla gratia neceſſaria ad ſalutem eos de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraudari qui unam ſpeciem ſolum accipiunt:</hi> This follows upon Chriſts being entire, and whole in each Species, as <hi>Caniſius</hi> affirms, <hi>

               <p>As for thoſe of the Antient Church, had they believ'd that Chriſt ſo inſtituted the Bleſſed Sacrament, as that he would not have one part taken without the other, and look'd on the uſage of the Cup as of the Eſſence of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, neceſſary to Salvation, they would not have Communicated under one Species only, as it is apparent they did; and the cuſtom hereof is ſo antient, that its Cradle and beginning cannot be defin'd. It was practis'd in the time of Perſecution in Domeſtick Communions, in which the Euchariſt was delivered to the Faithful under one Form, to be carried home; as may be prov'd out of <hi>Tertull. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ad <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xorem. Cyprian Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Lapſis. Ambroſ. Orat</hi> in the Death of his Brother <hi>Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> It was given to Children, Sick People, and Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in one kind. And that they did ſo in their Churches, is highly probable by the <hi>Manicheans,</hi> hiding and lurking amongſt them, who could never have found ſhelter and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62666:37"/> opportunity of Communicating with Catholicks had the uſe of the Cup been frequent, they being a ſort of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who by the Principles of their Religion would not drink Wine, abhorring it as a thing unlawful to be drunk, as a Creature of the Devil, as <hi>Fel Draconis;</hi> and ſo ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly abſtaining from the <hi>Chalice;</hi> in deteſtation of which Hereſie, the Church Commanded Communion in both kinds, not as if the other were either unlawful or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, but for the detection of thoſe Hereticks, purſuant to their Excluſion from Catholick Societies: At that time the Biſhops, to cruſh and extirpate that Hereſie, highly extol'd and commended the uſe of the <hi>Chalice;</hi> but that Error being extinct, and in proceſs of time, another He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie ariſing againſt the Eſſential Integrity of Chriſts Body under either kind; as alſo, avouching the abſolute indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable neceſſity of both, the Church began univerſally to practice Communion under one kind; and to confute this Error, did not only declare, and publiſh the Truth by her Decrees and Definitions, but likewiſe by her Practice; well knowing, that as it was not unlawful in its ſelf to Communicate under both ſorts; ſo it was likewiſe not neceſſary, but in its own nature indifferent, and ſo conſequently determinable to one or both kinds, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Diſcretion of the Church, the Precinct and Line of whoſe Power extendeth it ſelf to things Adiapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; for things abſolutely Commanded Man cannot forbid, nor Command things abſolutely forbidden. This thing being thus of a middle nature, was as ſuch within the territory of the Churches Legiſlative Power, which according to the differences of Place, Time, and Perſons, hath power to enjoyn both, or command but one, as the juncture of Affairs may be, and the benefit of the Church may require; and upon theſe accounts the Church may reſtore the Cup again, having Power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62666:37"/> in this Point of Diſcipline, according as may be moſt advantageous to its Peace and Unity; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as a tender Mother for quietneſs ſake, ſhe reſtor'd the Cup to the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and there is no queſtion but that ſhe would have granted it you upon that account, had it been requeſted before your Revolt, rather than ſee you periſhing in Damnable Schiſm. Now that the Church has this Power is acknowledged by the Council of <hi>Baſil Seſſ.</hi> 30. <hi>Eccleſia quae regitur Spiritu veritatis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare habet quomodo ipſis non conficientibus miniſtretur, prout pro reverentia ipſius Sacramenti &amp; ſalute fidelium viderit expedire;</hi> and accordingly the Council of Trent, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Declarat Synodus hanc poteſtatem perpetuo in Eccleſia fuiſſe, ut in Sacramentorum diſpenſatione ſalvâ illorum ſubſtantia ea ſtatueret, vel mutaret, quae ſuſcipientium utilitati, ſeu ipſorum Sacramentorum venerationi pro rerum, temporum, locorum varietate magis expedire judicaret:</hi> Hence 'tis that the Church varied from the firſt inſtitution in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to time, which was then after Supper, whereas 'tis now taken faſting, and before Dinner; ſo I believe, that Chriſt did not ſtrictly tie us up to the firſt inſtitution, but left it to the diſcretion of the Apoſtles (who afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd it to the Judgment of the Succeeding Church;) this ſeems to be St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Senſe of it, <hi>Non praecepit quo deinceps ordine ſumeretur, ut Apoſtolis per quos Eccleſias diſpoſiturus erat ſervaret hunc locum,</hi> 118 <hi>Epiſt. ad Januari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi> and certainly 'tis more fit that this Power ſhould be lodg'd in the Hands of the Church, than committed to the Arbitrement of Private Perſons; and you had better, herein have acquieſced in her Determinations than in your own Elections; for what have you gain'd by extorting this Cup, but inſtead of a Cup of Salvation, a baneful Potion, your departure and Schiſm from the Church, tainting your very Sacraments, and poiſoning the very

               <p>THe Fourth Point by which you would prove the <hi>Roman</hi> Church guilty of Paternal Schiſm, is, her Publick Prayers in Latin. This Point is highly oppoſed, and fancied to be againſt the Word of God, as contrary to the Senſe of the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14. which is generally brought againſt it, and fully believ'd by your Flock; tho' if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, nothing to the purpoſe; for this place do's not reprove the Practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in having her Liturgy in Latin, but prohibits Extemporary Prayers in Publick Meetings in an unknown Tongue, according to the Inſpir'd infus'd Devotion of the Speaker: Here is not a Word concerning <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Common Liturgy</hi> (which hath ſet known Offices for every Day); If there were, it would be an admirable place for you to confute Fanaticks, and to eſtabliſh your Common-Prayer againſt Sectaries. I know no reaſon why the Weſtern Church ſhould not have the liberty to make uſe of the Latin in her Religious Worſhip,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62666:38"/> (which is her Sacred and Learned Language, and in her extent the moſt generally known) as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> uſe the Hebrew, or the Eaſtern Churches the Greek, which, altho' conſiſting of ſeveral Nations that ſpeak Languages as much different from Greek as ours is from Latin: Nay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the Grecians have loſt their own Language, which is now no more reſemblant to the Learn'd Greek, than French is to Latin; yet they retain their Liturgy unalter'd in the pure Language of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> not underſtood but by the Learned. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Preface in <hi>Paralip.</hi> ſays, That in thoſe Days all thoſe Churches were ſerv'd in Greek, uſing <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Liturgy. And <hi>Alexander Roſs</hi> will tell you in his Review of Religion, That the <hi>Copthies, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites, Georgians, Circaſſians,</hi> and others, to whom you will give the Right-hand of fellowſhip, uſe not their vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Language, but an unknown Tongue to the Vulgar in their Divine Service. Now you muſt underſtand, that it is no Poſition of the Catholick Church, that the Publick Service ſhould be in an unknown Tongue; but it being Compos'd at firſt, ever ſince the Apoſtles days in Latin in the Weſtern Church, the Church did not think it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that it ſhould be turn'd into the Vulgar Barbarous Language of every Nation. This was not Englands caſe alone, but <hi>France, Spain, Germany, Poland, &amp;c.</hi> far'd no otherwiſe; nay moſt, part of the World, according to St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in his Book <hi>de verâ Religione. Quotidie per or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem univerſum humanum genus unâ pene voce reſpondet ſurſum corda ſe habere ad Deum.</hi> And that the Divine Service was in <hi>Africa</hi> perform'd in the Latin, and not in the Punic Language, is evidently to be prov'd out of the ſame Father in his Second Book <hi>de Doctrina Chriſt.</hi> and in his Expoſition on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123. But if you had a mind to quarrel with the Church for this, it might have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun ſeveral hundred Years paſt; for it can be prov'd, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62666:39"/> this Nation us'd Latin in her Publick Service above Nine hundred Years ago, as is evident out of the Council of <hi>Cloves Hoviae,</hi> under Archibiſhop <hi>Cuthbert.</hi> But that which gives me full ſatisfaction herein, is, that our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who made us Chriſtians, taught us to ſerve God in that Language; and this ſeems not to be only out of high reſpect to God Almighty, to ſerve him in Publick Liturgies, not in the Common, Profane, Vulgar Tongue, but in the moſt Pure, Sacred Language; but it ſeems like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to denote Unity, that the Church which is united in the ſame Faith ſhould join as much as poſſible in the ſame Language; by this means any one of her Communion may join in her Liturgy in any part of the Juriſdiction of the Weſtern Church, a <hi>German</hi> if in <hi>Italy,</hi> a <hi>Frenchman</hi> if in <hi>Poland,</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> if in <hi>Spain, &amp;c.</hi> Neither are the People ſo ignorant of theſe Prayers as you would perſuade your Party; for the Liturgy having ſet Offices for every day, and being in one ſet Language; they by vertue of their <hi>Catechiſms, Manuals, Prayers</hi> and <hi>Pſalters</hi> in the Vulgar Tongue, (where the Prayers uſed by the Church, are found, and likewiſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> proper to every day) have ſeveral other Books Expounding the Churches Service to the meaneſt capacity: Beſides the Prieſts are very ſolicitous herein, aſſiſting them by their private Inſtructions, ſo that the Senſe of the Churches Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy is well underſtood, even by Women and Perſons of ordinary Capacity. But this Practice of the Church, in having her Liturgy in Latin, being no Article of Belief, but rather a Point of Church Diſcipline, and as ſuch, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable, but changable (whereas Articles of Faith are unalterable) you, who knew 'twas in the Power of the Church to gratify you herein, ſhould have fairly requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it before you made the breach, and took upon you to tamper with Articles of Faith before your expelling
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62666:39"/> and depoſing your Spiritual Guids. It may be, the Church, to prevent a greater inconvenience might have humour'd you, condeſcending to what might have ſeem'd moſt expedient; for long ago it was permitted to other Nations in her Communion, as to the <hi>Sclavonians</hi> by Pope <hi>John</hi> the Eighth, and to the <hi>Chineſes</hi> by <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, to make uſe of their own Languages in their Divine Worſhip; the Church do's not hold it as unlawful, but as not expedient every where to celebrate in the Vulgar Tongue, as ſhe declares in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fifth Point is St. <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacy. This is, I muſt confeſs, an Article which all Catholicks are oblig'd to believe; and becauſe it is of high import, being the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of Papacy, I intend to Diſcouſe of it at large, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Point, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy: This flows naturally from the Fifth, <hi>Jure ſucceſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> being the Firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> inveſted with Univerſal Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>The Seventh, is the Popes Infallibility; to which I ſhall ſay nothing till you can prove it to be an Article of Faith to believe the Pope Infallible, ſeparated from a General Council. As for his granting Indulgences to break Gods Law (as you accuſe him of) that is a falſe Crime of your own hatching; for we deny any thing of that Nature, knowing his Power to be converſant in things indifferent. As for his abſolving Subjects of their Allegiance to their Princes; when 'tis acknowledged as an Article of Catholick Faith, I ſhall Diſcourſe of it; in the interim I will only hope that no Perſon will abſolve you, or that you will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve your ſelf of your Allegiance; and herein we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no more of you, than that you be as good Subjects to this preſent Prince, and ſtand by him with your Lives and Fortunes, as we did by his Royal Brother and Father.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:62666:40"/>
               <p>Your enſuing Diſcourſe is to prove the <hi>Roman</hi> Church guilty of Fraternal Schiſm; for this you have Three ſtrong Reaſons.</p>
               <p>The Firſt is, <hi>becauſe ſhe renounces Communion with other Churches,</hi> &amp;c. As to this I muſt needs tell you, that it is an high piece of injuſtice in you wilfully to revolt from her, and then falſly to accuſe her of renouncing Communion with you. 'Tis clear enough, that ſhe rejects no Church that hath not Schiſmatically fallen off from her; and ſo found guilty of Schiſm and Hereſie.</p>
               <p>The Second is, <hi>Becauſe ſhe denounces all damn'd, who ſubmit not to her.</hi> This you look on as very hard and uncharitable, tho' the Church herein is not blamable; but thoſe who diſ-join themſelves from her, and ſtand in oppoſition to her; ſhe can do no leſs than acquaint them of their unhappy Eſtate; this ſhe do's out of kindneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſeverity, that they being thereby made ſenſible of their deſperate condition, may return to her Boſom, and ſo avoid that Condemnation which attends thoſe who depart this life unreconcil'd to her. Her plain dealing in this caſe has much more of tenderneſs than your Latitudinarian Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which flatters poor Souls with falſe hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and then conſigns them into the Hands of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cheating their baffled expectancy of their imaginary Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>If you accuſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church of rigidneſs herein, you may bring the ſame Indictment againſt all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there being not one Point in which they are more poſitive than concerning the Unity of the Church, and that out of its Pale Eternal Life is unattainable, <hi>Nemini ſalus niſi in Eccleſia, Cyprian</hi> 62 <hi>Epiſt. ad Pomp.</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in his 204 Epiſt. to <hi>Donatus</hi> ſays, <hi>Foris ab Eccleſia conſtitutus aeterno ſupplicio punieris, etiamſi pro Chriſti no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Vivus incendereris.</hi> The Fathers are ſo ſtrict herein,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62666:40"/> that they look on that Perſon, who ſeparates from the Catholick Church, to be in a damnable ſtate, tho' he leads a Religious, Devout and Vertuous Life; <hi>Quiſquis ab hac Catholicâ Eccleſiâ fuerit ſeparatus, quantumlibet laudabiliter vivere ſe exiſtimet, hoc ſolo ſcelere quod a Chriſti unitate fuerit ſejunctus, non habet vitam, ſed ira Dei manet ſuper ipſum,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to <hi>Donatus;</hi> the Reaſon is, becauſe being ſeparated from the Catholick Church, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſeparated from Chriſt, who is the Head to that Myſtical Body: Another Reaſon is, <hi>Quia in unâ Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>câ Eccleſia vera hoſtia redemptionis immolatur.</hi> The Third Reaſon may be, <hi>Quia ſola eſt per quam Sacrificium Dominus libenter accipiat,</hi> as I find it, St. <hi>Auſt. Serm.</hi> 181. <hi>de temp.</hi> He has one Reaſon more in his 50 Epiſt. <hi>Quia extra hoc Corpus neminem vivificat Spiritus Sanctus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Third Reaſon to prove <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of Fraternal Schiſm, is, <hi>Becauſe ſhe ſends her Emiſſaries into the known World,</hi> &amp;c. But inſtead of accuſing her for this, had you not been of an ungrateful temper, you might have taken a fair opportunity of thanking her for ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Apoſtles to convert this Nation to Chriſtianity, when we lay in the impure Arms of Heatheniſm. But why ſhould you take offence at her ſending perſons to propagate the Goſpel, even to the Remoteſt, and moſt Barbarous Countreys, as long as you (whilſt they are in the midſt of Perſecutions and Martyrdoms) enjoy the ſoft Embraces of a Wife, and the affluence of United Livings?</p>

                  </gap>, tracing the print of your Footſteps, and in as ſuccinct a manner as I could examin'd your Reaſons to clear your Church of Schiſm, and to derive that crime on <hi>Rome,</hi> they have appear'd to me too infirm, either to juſtifie the one, or to caſt the other. As for your accuſing her of Errors, that being but ſuppos'd, and not prov'd, it imports nothing. Your Proofs to evince her Doctrines erroneous, muſt be as manifeſt as your Actual Schiſm; and your Arguments to juſtify your Schiſm muſt not be conjectural or Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but they muſt be as Oſtenſive and as Irreſiſtable as that you made it. Nay, you muſt prove her guilty of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrines, and that Salvation was not attainable in her Communion; or elſe you can expect none out of it. For to accuſe the Church of Error, and upon that account to depart from her, is Inevitable Perdition without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. I know it was always cuſtomary with her Enemies to object unto her the want of Truth; but this was done by Schiſmaticks, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> well obſerv'd, <hi>Hoc dicunt qui in Eccleſiâ non ſunt:</hi> Upon this falſe ſurmiſe they au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciouſly attempt the reforming of her Doctrines, broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new ones in oppoſition to them, which is done to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62666:41"/> authenticate and juſtify their Seceſſion. This was anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently obſerv'd by St. <hi>Hierom. Nullum Schiſma non ſibi ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam fingit Haereſim, ut recte ab Eccleſiâ receſſiſſe videatur.</hi> Firſt they ſeparate, and ſo become Schiſmaticks; then they mint new Articles of Belief, and ſo turn Hereticks; one follows upon the Neck of the other, for they never continue long disjoin'd: Schiſm being a very fair ſtep to Hereſie, and Generally a Harbinger to it. <hi>Quis unquam Haereſes inſtituit niſi qui ſe prius ab Eccleſiae Catholicae univerſitate &amp; antiquitatis conſenſione diſcreverit,</hi> ſays <hi>Vinc. Lyrinenſis.</hi> I know that in this caſe, Truth is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, tho' indeed it is Pride and Arrogance which makes Men give the preference to their own Private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and which keeps them from ſubmitting to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of the Church; for had they really with a pure ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour affected Truth, they had never gone out of her, who is the Pillar of Truth; out of which, when once departed, they muſt not expect a Pillar of Fire to Pilote them, but fooliſh Fires and Spirits of Deluſion to miſguide them through all the Serpentine windings and Mazes of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. <hi>In ventre Eccleſiae veritas manet, quiſquis ab hoc ventre Eccleſiae fuerit ſeparatus, neceſſe eſt ut falſo loquatur,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> on <hi>Pſalm</hi> 57.</p>
               <p>I am apt to believe, that if you would but once diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant your ſelf from the Spells of your unhappy Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with an Impartial Judgment take a ſerious view of the Doctrines of the Church, as propos'd and explicated by her (not as wrongfully repreſented by her Adverſaries) that all thoſe little Mormo's and Spectres rais'd by an injurious deſcription of her Articles (which have hitherto frighted you) would diſappear, and that you then would be ſo captivated as not to be able to reſiſt the charms of her naked Truths. The force of Education is certainly great, and lays violent anticipations on the Judgment which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leads
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62666:42"/> us in our Elections, diſpoſing us to reject or embrace things, rather as they ſuit or jar with our firſt receptions and prepoſſeſſions, than by their conformity to Truth: Till theſe falſe Ideas be diſlodg'd, Truth can expect no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, but muſt ſtand excluded by Preconceptions. When this difficulty is conquer'd, you would do well to queſtion the Integrity of thoſe Authors who have wrote in defence of your New Religion, who firſt imbued your undiſcerning Minority, with adulterate Tinctures, and then you are to apply your ſelf with an unprejudicate Mind to thoſe Authors, who have oppos'd them. After this you muſt lay aſide all thoughts of Secular Advantage. No Sophiſter can be more fallacious than Intereſt: This impoſes on our yielding Temper, bribes our Judgments, and by ſecret Attractions, draws us to the wrong. This made <hi>Alexander</hi> ſo violently ſtand up for his <hi>Epheſian</hi> Goddeſs, tho' a falſe Deity; and accordingly the <hi>Pythoniſſa</hi> was a long time maintain'd, tho' poſſeſs'd with an impure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for the lucre that ſhe acquir'd for her owners. In the laſt place, you are to diveſt your ſelf of your Conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and high Opinion of your ſelf, aſſuming Humble Thoughts: Fancy not your ſelf unfallible in your Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Scripture, look on it as unbecoming and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant in you, to cenſure the Doctrines of the Church, and to oppoſe the Definitions of General Councils. When you ſhall have conquered all theſe Impedimental Obſtacles, you will ſoon deſcry thoſe Miſts which have hitherto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted your Underſtanding to retire; then through a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene and diſclouded Medium you will clearly ſee the verity of Catholick Doctrines, and by Gods aſſiſtance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor'd, embrace them. <hi>Nullus pudor ad meliora tranſire.</hi> Amb.

               <p>The firſt thing that encounters my view, is your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing me of laying a falſe Hypotheſis at the Foundation of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacy, by my aſſerting, that he firſt knew Chriſt's Divinity: This you deny, affirming St. <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel</hi> to have got the ſtart of him in the knowledge of that Myſtery. Now becauſe the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every Fabrick ought to be firm and ſtrong to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Superſtructure, I ſhall throughly diſſect thoſe Reaſons you have made uſe of (as ſo many Machins) to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62666:48"/> evert and undermine my Hypotheſis; and manifeſt unto you how unſufficient and unable they be for ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and withal diſcover with what falſe Topicks you have deluded your ſelf. The Argument you uſe to evince St. <hi>Andrew</hi> elder in the knowledge of Chriſt's Divinity than St. <hi>Peter,</hi> is deriv'd from the firſt Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> where it appears, that St. <hi>Andrew</hi> was the firſt of the Apoſtles, who acknowledged our Saviour for the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias. <hi>Now</hi> (ſay you) <hi>he firſt knowing him to be the Meſſias, conſequently knew his Divinity, becauſe in the 9th. of</hi> Iſaias v. 5. <hi>the Emanuel is ſtyl'd God.</hi> This your Argument do's not ſeem forcible to me: For tho' I grant that the Meſſias is called ſo by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; yet it do's not follow that St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <hi>El,</hi> or <hi>Deus</hi> (which was not Gods Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable Name, but <hi>Jehovah)</hi> ſhould know the Meſſias to be the natural Son of God, of the ſame eſſence and ſubſtance with the Deity; but rather that he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him as ſome eminent Perſon, extraordinarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd by God, ſent to free the Jewiſh Nation from the Bondage of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to whom they were ſubjugated: This is <hi>Theophyl.</hi> his Opinion, they did expect that their Meſſias ſhould be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>; <hi>A Saviour and Redeemer from thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which lay upon them, and from the yoke of Bondage which the Romans had impos'd on them, and to Reign in a Terreſtrial Kingdom:</hi> This ſeems to be their plain Senſe of the Meſſias, and accordingly in the following Verſe of <hi>Iſaias,</hi> 'tis ſaid of him, <hi>Super ſolium</hi> David, <hi>&amp; ſuper regnum ejus ſedebit.</hi> This made <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> after he had confeſs'd Chriſt to be the Son of God, to add, <hi>Tu es Rex</hi> Iſrael. This made the Apoſtles before our Saviour's Reſurrection ambitiouſly to court the higheſt Preferment
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62666:48"/> and Dignity in his Kingdom, looking on it as Terrene, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable and Pompatick. And we find <hi>Cleophas</hi> (no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a Perſon than the Brother of St. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Father of the two Apoſtles St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>Jude,</hi> very intimate with the whole Apoſtolick Quire) in the Twenty fourth of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> to deſcribe our Saviour (in the Character he gives of him) not as the Conſubſtantial Son of God, but as an Eminent Man, an Illuſtrious Prophet, <hi>Jeſus</hi> Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus <hi>qui fuit vir Propheta potens in opere &amp; Sermone,</hi> &amp;c. Hence <hi>Theophyl.</hi> takes notice of his diminutive thoughts of Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>; <hi>See what a low and ſlender Opinion they had of our Lord, they call him a Man, a Prophet, ſuch an one as</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>or Moſes.</hi> Then he freely diſcovers what great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations they had fomented of his glorious Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Nos ſperabamus quod ipſe redempturus ſit</hi> Iſrael; upon which St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his Ninety ſixth Pſalm Enarrat. gloſſes thus, <hi>Jam ſpem perdiderant, non enim dixerunt ſperamus eum redempturum, ſed ſperabamus quòd eſſet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempturus</hi> Iſrael: And accordingly <hi>Theophyl.</hi> obſerves, that they ſpoke this, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>, <hi>as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated of their Hopes and Expectancy.</hi> Thus it ſeems ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that they looked on their Meſſias, as one that ſhould be <hi>Iſraels Reſtaurator, Redemptor, Liberator,</hi> as one ſent to raiſe up the fallen Kingdom of <hi>Judea,</hi> and to reſtore it to its Priſtine Glory, and to file its Luſtre as Radiant as it was in the Golden Days of King <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to come to the Hebrew word <hi>El</hi> or <hi>Deus,</hi> which is, the very Lock in which the ſtrength and nerve of your Argument lodgeth, none can by that word prove the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatick Union in the Meſſias, that he ſhould be very God of very God: God by Eſſence and Nature, becauſe he

This Recondit and Sublime Myſtery did tranſcend all the

Thus in <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 51. Chriſt asked them, <hi>if they underſtood all theſe things?</hi> they ſaid to him, <hi>Yes Lord.</hi> Chriſt asked them, <hi>How many Loaves they had?</hi> they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62666:54"/> anſwered, <hi>Seven.</hi> He asked them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. 31. <hi>Which of the two Brothers did his Fathers Will?</hi> they ſaid, <hi>The firſt.</hi> He asked them, <hi>Whether they wanted any thing, when he ſent them without Purſe, Scrip, or Shoes?</hi> they ſaid, <hi>Nothing.</hi> And in <hi>John</hi> 21. he asked them, <hi>Whether they had any thing to eat?</hi> they anſwered him, <hi>No.</hi> Theſe eaſie Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, you ſee they all anſwer'd as well as <hi>Peter;</hi> but when Chriſt propos'd this difficult Queſtion which we now treat of; all the reſt were ſilent, and <hi>Peter</hi> only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd it. 'Tis very obſervable, that tho' it was propos'd to them all in the Plural Number, <hi>Peter</hi> only reply'd to it, and in this, all the Evangeliſts, as many as mention it, agree exactly, as you may ſee in <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. <hi>Mark</hi> 8. and <hi>Luke</hi> 9. whereas in their raccounting other Paſſages they ſeem to vary.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis eaſily diſcernible when <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks for the Reſt, uttering their common Sentiment, by his ſpeaking in the Plural Number, as in St. <hi>John</hi> 6. upon our Saviors asking them, <hi>Nunquid &amp; vos vultis abire? Peter</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in the Plural Number in the name of all of them, <hi>Domine ad quem ibimus?</hi> Here <hi>Theophyl.</hi> obſerves, that he ſpake for all of them; his Reaſon was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>; <hi>For he did not ſay, to whom ſhall I go, but to whem ſhall we go?</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his 28th Tract. <hi>Johan. Reſpondit</hi> Petrus <hi>pro omnibus, unus pro multis, unitas pro univerſis, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ad quem ibimus? Repellis nos a te, da nobis alterum te. Peter</hi> likewiſe ſpake for them all when he ſaid, <hi>Ecce nos reliquimus omnia &amp; ſecuti ſumus te.</hi> Hence Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to them all in the Plural Number, <hi>Dico vobis quod vos qui ſecuti eſtis me,</hi> &amp;c. And likewiſe when in <hi>John</hi> 6. 69, he ſays, <hi>We belive and know that thou art Chriſt, the Son of the Living God:</hi> Here he undertook by anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Reſt, to give an account of their Faith; but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62666:55"/> he committed a great miſtake therein, for Chriſt told him, that that was not the belief of all of them, one of them being a Devil. When they were all accuſed, as warm'd with new Wine, <hi>Peter</hi> makes an Apologetical Harangue in the defence and name of them all. By theſe Paſſages 'tis obvious and tranſparent, that <hi>Peter</hi> herein was the Repreſentative of the Apoſtolick Society, venting in theſe his Reſponſals their joint and united Opinions; ſo I ſhall ſuperſede a further purſuit herein, and make it my preſent buſineſs to inform my ſelf in what Senſe ſome of the Fathers entitle him <hi>Os Apoſtolorum,</hi> whereas indeed they had as much liberty and freedom of ſpeaking to our Saviour as he had. The moſt Radiant and Plauſible Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion amongſt them, for their dubbing him their Speaker, was, becauſe they look'd on him as their Prince; and thus it may not improperly be ſaid in a ſubordinate Senſe, that what was ſpoken by the chief of the Society, was ſaid by the whole Company, he repreſenting them all as their Head and Prince; and in this Senſe it is that <hi>Cyril</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges <hi>Peter</hi> to have anſwered for the Reſt, as is apparent in ſeveral places of his Comments on St. <hi>John, Princeps Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putque caeterorum primus exclamat, Tu es Chriſtus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Per unum qui praeerat omnes reſpondent.

               <p>And accordingly 'tis very familiar with <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> after he has ſtyl'd him, The Mouth of the Apoſtles, to join another word with it, which denotes him to be chief; as in his 55th <hi>Hom. Matt.</hi>

               <p>THe next thing I am oblig'd to Diſcuſs, is, Whether or no the other Apoſtles had the ſame Senſe of Chriſt's Divinity as St. <hi>Peter</hi> had, when Chriſt propos'd this Queſtion to them, <hi>Vos autem quem me dicitis eſſe?</hi> So that <hi>Peter</hi> herein may be ſaid to have ſpoke but their Senſe, and that they knew, and could have anſwered the Queſtion as well as he. This is in ſhort, what you affirm, and what is atteſted by Modern Proteſtant Writers. Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> in the Life of St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays thus of him, <hi>Do's he confeſs Chriſt the Son of God? Beſides, that herein he ſpeaks but the Senſe of all the Reſt; this was no more than what others ſaid as well as he.</hi> Nathaniel <hi>expreſly told him, Thou art the Son of God.</hi> This is likewiſe Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi>'s Senſe of it, only he delivers it more Sportively and Comically in his Treatiſe of the Supremacy, <hi>p.</hi> 43. <hi>But who ſay ye that I am? up ſtarteth</hi> Peter, <hi>he skippeth forth and preventeth the other Apoſtles, not ignorant of the Point, they took Jeſus for the Meſſias, which according to the common notion of the Jews, did imply his being the Son of God; they had the ſame Faith, he from a ſpecial alacrity of Spirit, and expedition in utterance, more forward in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it.</hi> This Opinion ſeem'd to me very thin and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62666:56"/> That Chriſt ſhould propound a Queſtion to a Dozen Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which he knew any of them could ſolve, and make honorable Promiſes only to him that ſhould ſpeak firſt, ſeem'd to me a childiſh fancy, and beneath the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Doctor, this being not to reward an Excellency of Faith, but the promptitude of a nimble Tongue, which has nothing of Merit in it. Having now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the two above cited Doctors, I ſhall add ſomething more to their Quotations. <hi>Peter</hi> is ſaid to anſwer for the Reſt, not as if he ſpake or knew their Opinion on this Point; for the Queſtion was ask'd by our Savior on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and it do's no where appear, that the Apoſtles had any Praecedaneous Conference or Conſultation about it; but becauſe his Anſwer thereto was Orthodox, they were oblig'd to own and embrace it as the Common Belief of the Church. And I conceive, that upon our Saviors ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Queſtion, the reſt being ſilent, and ſuſpending their Anſwer, <hi>Peter</hi> firſt ſpake not their Common, but his Particular Sentiment; <hi>Suam fidem pro ſe profeſſus eſt,</hi> ſays <hi>Janſenius; Pro ſe ſolo reſpondit,</hi> ſays <hi>Abulenſis;</hi> and this he did as one made more knowing than the Reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtructed in this Myſtery by a particular Revelation from the Father. He then being more fervid than the Reſt, inflam'd by this illumination from God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated thereto by a Divine impulſe, haſtned with all ſpeed to deſcribe the Son as the Father had inſtructed him, leſt any of the Twelve ſhould ſpeak any thing beneath, and unworthy of Chriſt, and ſo be rebuked by him as they often were. This is what St. <hi>Chryſoſt</hi> means, when he ſays, <hi>Peter</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not a firſt <hi>ſtarting</hi> or <hi>hopping,</hi> or <hi>skipping,</hi> as the Doctor paints to himſelf in his deluded fancy; for St. <hi>Peter</hi> did not merit any thing by ſpeaking firſt, and ſo preventing them by the glibneſs of a voluble Tongue, but by the eminency of his Faith,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62666:57"/> by his anticipating the reſt in the knowledge of that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: Hence 'tis as <hi>Janſenius</hi> obſerves, <hi>Cum Chryſoſtomus &amp; alii eum vocant Os, &amp; nomine omnium reſpondiſſe, non ſic ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiendum quaſi reſponderit id quod omnes ſentirent, ſed quia ſolus reſponderit quod omnibus reſpondendum fuiſſet.</hi> Now if the other Apoſtles did equally know it with <hi>Peter,</hi> and he only ſpake their Senſe for them, I ſhall with <hi>Maldonat</hi> ask this Queſtion, <hi>Si pro omnibus</hi> Petrus <hi>loquebatur, cur non omnibus dictum beati eſtis? Cur non omnibus mutata nomina? Cur non omnibus dictum vobis dabo,</hi> &amp;c. Beſides it ſeems ſtrange to me that the reſt ſhould be able to underſtand this Myſtery without a Revelation; and that <hi>Peter,</hi> who in other things was more forward and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trant, ſhould here be ſo dull and unapprehenſive as not to diſcover this without a particular Beam from the <hi>Father of Light;</hi> for had he underſtood it before, the Revelation had been ſuperfluous: But herein Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> was pleas'd to lend me his <hi>charitable Hand,</hi> by clearing up this doubt to me in theſe words, <hi>I muſt in Charity</hi> (ſays he) <hi>believe, that ſome other of the Twelve acknowledg'd the Divinity of Chriſt, and had it reveal'd to them by the Father.</hi> This ſeem'd at firſt very appoſite; but when I conſidered that the Doctor could not poſſibly prove any Revelation either at or before that time, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divinity of our Savior, to any of the Twelve, but to <hi>Peter;</hi> I concluded, that what the Doctor was pleas'd to call <hi>Charity,</hi> was really <hi>Policy:</hi> So I left him, and apply'd my ſelf to St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> as being the abler Man, and he acquainted me, that the other Apoſtles were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it, on <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. <hi>Ignorantibus caeteris primus, Reſpondit, Tu es,</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>Now what concerns the other Apoſtles, altho' I grant, that they took Chriſt to be the Shiloh or Meſſias, yet that did not imply to them his being Gods Natural Son, <hi>Per identitatem ſubſtantiae,</hi> but rather an Imputative, or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive Son: And this their belief did amount to no more than this, <hi>Credimus te eſſe Meſſiam, quem ſcimus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cari Filium Dei.</hi> Now altho' they call'd him <hi>Filius Dei,</hi> and thereby ſeem'd to know his Name, they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his Nature, whereas <hi>Peter,</hi> by vertue of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation knew both. <hi>Complexus eſt omnia, qui nomen &amp; naturam complexus eſt,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſius</hi> ſays: And herein lies the difference 'twixt <hi>Peters</hi> knowledge and theirs. For the true knowledge of the Meſſias conſiſted in knowing his Nature, as <hi>Hilarius</hi> obſerves, <hi>Gloria Revelationis Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae ſcilicet non nominis, cum frequentata nominis profeſſio jam fuiſſet.</hi> 'Twas ordinary and common with them to call an egregious Perſon <hi>Filius Dei.</hi> Hence the Seamen upon his appeaſing the tumultuous Sea, called him ſo. 'Tis not at all probable, that ſuch rude illiterate People ſhould know the Myſtery of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> his Conſubſtantiality
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62666:58"/> with God. The Centurian likewiſe in St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſays of him, <hi>Vere hic homo filius erat Dei,</hi> which ſaying is very well explain'd by St. <hi>Luke, Vere hic homo juſtus erat;</hi> this word <hi>Filius,</hi> is aſcrib'd to Men as well as Chriſt, as <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> affirms in his 4th <hi>Hom. de incompreh.

               </p>
               <p>Having plainly evidenc'd the difference 'twixt <hi>Peters</hi> Sentiments of Chriſt, and that of the other Apoſtles: I ſhall add this, That the Fathers, when they incidently ſay, That the other Apoſtles knew Chriſt to be the Son of God, before <hi>Peters</hi> promulging him ſo, do mean thereby his Nominal, and not his Natural Filiation: If they do not mean ſo, they muſt prove, that the others had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of that kind; for I will never be induc'd to believe otherwiſe than that St. <hi>Peters</hi> Revelation did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to him more than either what he or they knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, otherwiſe it had been of no import. That which confirms me in this my Opinion concerning the Fathers, is, becauſe I find St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in one place to affirm, that the other Apoſtles knew Chriſt to be the Son of God as well as <hi>Peter;</hi> and in another place, to ſeem to appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it wholly to him, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Lucae.

               <p>After all this you are to take notice, that altho' I have ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt that knew Chriſt's Divinity, I have hitherto made a Compariſon of him, only with the other Apoſtles; with <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> the Centurion, and the ordinary Perſons Aboard-ſhip; not with the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom I dare not affirm, or think to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that Myſtery after ſhe was inform'd by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy of the Arch-Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> that ſhe ſhould Conceive, and bring forth the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who ſhould be called <hi>The Son of God;</hi> the <hi>Son of the Moſt High.</hi> She, who was ſo highly honor'd by every Perſon of the Holy Triad, could not but know the Myſtery of the <hi>Trinity:</hi> She, whom the Holy Ghoſt by ſupervening did ingravidate: She, whom the Power of the Higheſt (God the Father) did Obumbrate: She, whoſe Virginal Womb was the Manſion and Mother-Pearl to God the Son, cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be ſuppos'd to be neſcient of his Natural Filia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yet after all this, it ſeems as if all were not then revealed unto her, for ſhe is ſaid to wonder at what Old <hi>Simeon</hi> told her, which is a ſign it was new unto her.</p>
               <p>Neither dare I exclude St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt from the knowledge of this Myſtery, he who was fill'd with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt from his Mothers Womb; even when he was in that Confinement, by his ſupernatural skipping and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting may be ſaid to have known him, to have ſaluted him, and to have paid him Tributary Homage: He, who heard a None from Heaven by a Celeſtial Herald, promulging him to be the Son of God: He, who ſaw the Holy Ghoſt effigiated in the form of a Dove, deſcending from above, and lighting upon him, may very well be imagin'd to have been inſtructed who he was.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Joſeph, Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> the Propheteſs, who were honor'd with Revelations and Viſions, fill'd with the Holy Ghoſt, and had the gift of

               <p>I ſhall add but one thing more on this Subject, and that is concerning the Devils knowing of Chriſt; and herein St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is very poſitive, acknowledging but little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference 'twixt their Confeſſion of Chriſt, and that of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s, as will appear by ſeveral paſſages in his Writings; Petrus <hi>dixit, Tu es Chriſtus filius Dei vivi: &amp; Dominus, Beatus es</hi> Simon Barjona, &amp;c. <hi>O Domine, hoc tibi dixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt Daemones, quare ipſi non ſunt beati; quia Daemones hoc dixerunt timore,</hi> Petrus <hi>amore, Hom.</hi> 6.

               </p>
               <p>Now, how the Devil did arrive to this Knowledge, Opinions are various; ſome Divines hold, that when he was a glorious Angel in Heaven, God revealed unto him, that his Son ſhould aſſume Humane Nature, and that Man ſhould be exalted to the Hypoſtatick Union with the <hi>WORD.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62666:60"/> Opinion of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Scholiaſt, who upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils pretending to know Chriſt in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> by his ſaying, <hi>Scio qui ſcis,</hi> ſays, he meant by <hi>Scio, ſuſpicor, conjector, opinor:</hi> And indeed, 'tis much to be queſtioned, whether he had <hi>firmam &amp; certam notitiam adventûs filii Dei;</hi> for tho' it were granted, that he did hear the Oracle of God from Heaven; yet, on the other ſide, ſeeing Chriſt in the form and appearance of an ordinary <hi>Plebeian</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Poor, Low and Humble, and ſeeming to be in want of Bread; he in his Haughty, Proud Thoughts, ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Poverty and Humility of Chriſt Incarnate, did look on this his Lowlineſs and Condeſcenſion incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with his Majeſtick Divinity: This made him accoſt our Savior to ſatisfie this his Doubt and Scruple, which did ſo much excruciate him, but he addreſſes himſelf as one doubting, <hi>Si filius es Dei?</hi> This is agreeable to the Senſe of <hi>Theophyl.</hi> on <hi>Matt.</hi> 4. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <p>HAving diſpatch'd St. <hi>Peters</hi> Solution to our Saviors Queſtion, I ſhall next take Chriſts Reply unto him in to Examination: And this, tho' it ſeems in it ſelf to be the plaineſt and moſt intelligible thing imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as not containing one difficult word in it; yet if taken with the Gloſſes which the Oppoſers of <hi>Peters</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy have affix'd to it, it may appear to be as knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a place as any; as if the intent of Commentators were not to illuſtrate dark Texts, but to raiſe Duſt and obſcure Serene Paſſages; not to dilucidate what may ſeem dubious, and ſo expoſe the unqueſtion'd Truth, but to make Scripture ſerviceable to that Intereſt and Deſign they are a moulding; of which unwarrantable dealing, this place is a moſt Pregnant Example, being by the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Interpretations of Men of different Perſuaſions rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, perplex'd, and impregnated with varieties of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. As whether, what Chriſt promiſed here, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> or to himſelf? If to <hi>Peter,</hi> whether to his Perſon, or to his Faith and Confeſſion? Or if to his Perſon, whether to that alone, or equally to his fellow
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62666:61"/> Apoſtles? Or if to all the Apoſtles, whether not to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Scholar and Diſciple of Chriſt? Or again, whether to <hi>Peter</hi> perſonally only, or extendible to his Succeſſors? Theſe, in ſhort, are the numerous off-ſpring of Queſtions, which are rais'd out of the Fruitful Womb of this Text. As to the laſt of theſe Queries, whether what was ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> be extendible to his <hi>Roman</hi> Succeſſors? I find Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Writers to hold the Affirmative, aſſerting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Papacy to be grounded on Holy Writ, and inſtituted by a Divine Irreverſible Sanction of Chriſt in <hi>Peter.</hi> The Enemies to the Apoſtolick See, eagerly deny and oppoſe this Opinion. <hi>Calvin</hi> is herein very bold, his words are theſe, <hi>Quicquid accepit</hi> Petrus <hi>nihilo magis ad Papam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet quam ad</hi> Mahometam. <hi>Nihil</hi> Petro <hi>datum eſt his verbis quod non omnibus Evangelii Miniſtris perinde ſit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune. Beza</hi> is very taunting, who tho' he denies the Pope to ſucceed him as he was called <hi>Peter,</hi> yet he frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grants his Succeſſion to him as he was called <hi>Satan. In hoc quidem cognomine ſucceſſiſſe Antichriſtum libens conceſſero.</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> is very facetious in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon preach'd on 5. <hi>Novemb. So dark and obſcure</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſo impertinent are the Proofs brought from Scripture of the Popes Supremacy, that I may ſay, that</hi> Ariſtotle<hi>'s Politick's do prove it much more better than any Text in the Bible. Eraſmus</hi> ſeems very ambiguous in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on St. <hi>Matt.</hi> where he plays faſt and looſe, <hi>dictum indictum,</hi> ſays and unſays. Firſt, he wonders any ſhould apply thoſe words to the Pope; then he ſays they do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly belong to him as Prince of Chriſtians; his words are theſe, <hi>Miror eſſe qui hunc locum detorqueant ad</hi> Romanum <hi>Pontificem in quem haud dubiè competunt in primis velut in Chriſtianae fidei Principem,</hi> &amp;c. Now that which induces me to believe, that if the Church were built on <hi>Peter,</hi> it was likewiſe built on his Succeſſors,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62666:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> is, becauſe Chriſts main deſign of coming into the World being to purchaſe to himſelf a Church which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the conſummation of the World; 'tis abſurd to imagine this Church ſhould have a viſible Foundation and Head, for <hi>Peter</hi>'s life-time, and to have none after him. This Power then and Office of his, was not conferr'd on his individual Perſon, ſo as to ceaſe at his expiration, but was granted him as the Myſtical Head of the whole; but ſo as to be tranſient, and ſurvive in his Succeſſors. And indeed this is the chief reaſon, why thoſe that oppoſe the Power of <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor, ſtrike firſt at his Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, knowing that as the Admiſſion of the one, infers the other, ſo the ſupplanting of the one undermines the other. Biſhop <hi>Bramhal</hi> in his <hi>Schiſm Guarded,</hi> having affirm'd, That <hi>all that</hi> Peter <hi>had, was a beginning of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> adds this, <hi>What</hi> Peter <hi>had the Pope may pretend a right to:</hi> That Chriſt did inſtitute in the <hi>Peter</hi> the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of Unity is acknowledg'd by the Fathers, but that this Unity can be preſerv'd without a Paramount Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, will never be made out: And if Chriſt made the beſt proviſion imaginable for the preſervation of Unity, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have done all that is poſſible for its Violation.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> ſays, he would not much value the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Peters</hi> being the Foundation, if the Catholicks would not extend it to the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſocios collegaſque hujus dignitatis. Si</hi> Petrum (ſays he) <hi>creatum eſſe ſummum Paſtorem Eccleſiae concedimus, id ipſum mox inferunt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militer ad omnes</hi> Petri <hi>Succeſſores pertinere.</hi> This is the ſole reaſon why his Supremacy is ſo warmly oppos'd; for its Enemies know very well, if that be granted, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as his Heirs have a fair Title to it: This makes them exert all their cunning endeavours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud <hi>Peter</hi> of it; and then deluding themſelves with an imaginary Conqueſt, as if they had ſubverted that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62666:62"/> to infer, That if the Original had it not, the Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive could not have it. With this falſe ſuppoſition Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> impoſes on himſelf, and on ſuch as adhere to him, <hi>What</hi> Peter <hi>had not himſelf</hi> (ſays he) <hi>he could not devolve to any of his Succeſſors, the Derivative Power in his Succeſſors being like Water that flows from a Spring, apt to aſcend no higher than the Fountain ſtood.</hi> But now if it be made app<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear, that <hi>Peter</hi> was by Chriſt inveſted with the Supremacy, it will be evident, that the Doctor built a ruinous Fabrick upon a falſe Foundation. But to return to the Point, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were concern'd in what was ſaid to St. <hi>Peter?</hi> To this I reply, That I find ſeveral of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Popes, to make uſe of theſe words, as if by vertue of them—the <hi>Roman</hi> See had its Primacy. <hi>Anaclet</hi> ſays, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſancta</hi> Romana <hi>Apoſtolica Eccleſia non ab Apoſtolis, ſed ab ipſo Domino Salvatore noſtro Primatum obtinuit, dicente, Tu es</hi> Petrus, &amp;c. And <hi>Gelaſius</hi> likewiſe in his Epiſtle to all Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Biſhops, <hi>Evangelicâ voce Domini, &amp; Salvatoris noſtri Primatum obtinuit, dicente, Tu es</hi> Petrus, &amp;c. <hi>Alexander, Calixtus,</hi> and others, have Sayings to the ſame effect. Theſe Men, I know, are rejected by Proteſtant Authors as Men partial in their own caſe; as you may ſee by Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> who delivers his mind very plainly, <hi>Quid illi dicunt de ſua ſede nos non moramur; erant hi Pontifices</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani <hi>quibus inſitum eſt, ſuam ſedem, quantum poſſunt, ornare, &amp; extollere ementitis privilegiis.</hi> This his Senſe of their Actions I could by no means embrace, for it ſeem'd to me very uncharitable to imagine, that thoſe Religious Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, ſo nigh to the Apoſtolick Age, Perſons of ſo ſtrict Piety, and unſpotted Converſation, living under horrid Perſecutions, ſhould conſpire to advance their Sees by falſe Maxims and forg'd Priviledges: But I am more inclinable to believe, that thoſe great Prieſts, who were both Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Martyrs, ſealing their Religion with their Blood,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62666:62"/> were not only extraordinarily illuminated in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Goſpel, but ſincere in their Expoſitions and Applications of it. But beſides the Teſtimonies of theſe Great Men, I find that <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> together with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Aegypt, Thebais</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> conven'd in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrine</hi> Council in their Epiſt. to <hi>Faelix</hi> to ſpeak much to the ſame effect, <hi>Romana ſedes, cui ab ipſo Domino poteſtas ligandi &amp; ſolvendi ſpeciali eſt privilegio ſuper alios conceſſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall add but one thing more on this matter, and that is concerning the Opinion of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the <hi>Milevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Council about the Popes Power, from whence 'twas deriv'd? They in a Letter to <hi>Innocentius,</hi> beg of him, that he would exert his Paſtoral Power, <hi>in magnis membro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Chriſti periculis,</hi> by repreſſing the Hereticks, <hi>Caeleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Pelagius</hi> infecting <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine</hi> with their falſe Doctrin, in this caſe, why did they not write to the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or to the Primate of <hi>Africa?</hi> The Reaſon given, is, becauſe they concluded thoſe Hereticks would with more eaſe yield to <hi>Innocentius,</hi> as to one whoſe Authority was drawn from the Scripture. Now this Power which they did deſire him to ſhew, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Dioceſan nor Patriarchal, but his Papal Power, for <hi>Paleſtine</hi> was no Limb of the <hi>Weſtern,</hi> but <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchate, and conſequently out of his Juriſdiction, as he was the Occidental Patriarch. This Power of his, which they deſire him to make uſe of, they acknowledg'd to be drawn out of the Scripture, which cannot be made out, but by what was ſpoken by Chriſt to <hi>Peter:</hi> And this is the Method St. <hi>Bernard</hi> uſes in his Book of Conſiderations to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who having attributed high things to him, proves what he ſays, <hi>ex dictis Domini:</hi> I ſhall now come to take a view of the words, which the Fathers, in the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Council, (of which <hi>Auſtin</hi> was one) uſed to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius,</hi> which in Epiſt. 92. of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> I find were
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62666:63"/> theſe, <hi>Arbitramur adjuvante miſericordiâ D. N. J. Chriſti Authoritati ſanctitatis tuae, de ſacrarum literarum autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate depromptae facilius eos qui tam perverſa &amp; perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioſa ſentiunt ceſſuros;</hi> The words are very plain, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovering their Opinion, that his Authority was from Scripture; but becauſe this is a truth that muſt be ſuppreſs'd, 'Tis very pleaſant to ſee how 'tis deprav'd by Expoſitors, <hi>Cedent authoritati tuoe de ſcripturarum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate depromptae,</hi> that is, ſays <hi>Chamier, Tibi veram doctrinam a Scripturis expromenti.</hi> But the intent of theſe words is not that <hi>Innocentius</hi> ſhould make them yield, by quoting of places out of the Scripture, and ſo confute their Hereſies (that the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops themſelves, or any other might have done if they had pleas'd) but by vertue of his Supreme, Eccleſiaſtick Authority, to which the Fathers imagin'd theſe Heretick would more readily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit as grounded on Scripture: This is the genuin Senſe of thoſe words, but I ſhall add no more on this Matter, but confine my following Diſcourſe chiefly to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</p>
               <p>Firſt, You muſt underſtand, that I do believe, as firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you do, that Chriſt is the Primary and Principal Foundation of the Church; the <hi>Lapis ſummus &amp; angula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, a nullo alio dependens,</hi> the <hi>Lapis fundamentalis, cui to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum innititur aedificium,</hi> on whom, not only every true Chriſtian, but the Apoſtles, and <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf is Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſuperedified, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> affirms, Petra <hi>erit Chriſtus ſuper quod fundamentum etiam aedificatus</hi> Petrus: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly St. <hi>Cyril</hi> in his Notes on <hi>Iſaias, Lib.</hi> 4. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62666:63"/> you may perceive, that we do not go about to deſpoil our Savior of his due Honor, and inveſt <hi>Peter</hi> with it (as you traduce us with) for if he be the Rock of Church, much more Chriſt is; to deny which would be Antichriſtian. But <hi>Peter</hi> is not hereby excluded, notwithſtanding this, but is likewiſe the Rock, but in Subordination and Inferiority to Chriſt.

Hence 'tis that <hi>Auſtin</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 86. entitles Chriſt the Foundation of Foundations. <hi>Fandamentum Chriſtus primum &amp; maximum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Si Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta cogites, Chriſtus ſanctus ſanctorum; ſi gregem ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum cogites, Chriſtus paſtor paſtorum; ſi fabricam cogites, Chriſtus fundamentum fundamentorum.</hi> Thus it ſeems to be in the Church, as in the State: For as in the State, notwithſtanding God by his Omnipotency and Wiſdom, tempers and diſpoſes all things as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: Yet has he eſtabliſh'd here on Earth Principacies, into whoſe Hands he has committed the Sword, whom we are in duty oblig'd to obey; ſo tho' Chriſt be the Moderator and Foundation of the Church, and do's rule and direct it by his Internal Influxes, yet has he eſtabliſh'd a Viſible Monarchick Government in it, with which he inveſted St. <hi>Peter,</hi> propagating it to his Succeſſors. Now tho' Chriſt did build his Church on <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> he himſelf is the main Baſis of the Structure; and as Chriſt is the Head of the Church, God is the Head of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62666:64"/> Chriſt, who by his Omnipotent Power ſupports and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains the vaſt pile of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>I ſhall next give you ſome Teſtimonies of the Fathers, who notwithſtanding their affirming Chriſt to be the Rock, diſrobe not St. <hi>Peter</hi> of that Illuſtrious Title, but aſcribe it to him Participatively, <hi>Tertul.

               <p>Thus you may diſcern, that our Saviors being the Rock, hinders not <hi>Peter</hi> from being ſo; neither doth <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> being the Rock exclude Chriſt from being ſo: This may be manifeſted out of St. <hi>Baſil</hi> 28th <hi>Hom. de Poenit.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THe next ſtratagem to thruſt out St. <hi>Peters</hi> Perſon, is your making his Faith or Confeſſion to be the <hi>Rock,</hi> and not his Perſon; and now I am to enter into a large Field of Matter, where I may juſtly expect to meet with varieties of Intricacies which will appear inſuperable; and I am ſenſible, that I ſhall find it a very difficult task to evolve my ſelf out of them; but having embarqu'd in this troubleoſme Matter, I ſhall not now daſtardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, but the more vigorous oppoſition I meet with, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra audentior ibo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe Fathers that aſſert Faith to be the Rock, take it not a part from <hi>Peters</hi> Perſon, but as inherent in him, they take his Faith as conjoin'd with his Perſon, or elſe his Perſon confeſſing the Faith; ſo when they call Faith the Rock, they take not theſe words ſimply and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>ſecundum ſe,</hi> but reſpectively with a perſonal relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Peter,</hi> they either take Faith <hi>cum aggregato</hi> Petri, or elſe they take <hi>Peter, cum adjuncto fidei;</hi> ſo their Senſe of the thing is plainly this, <hi>upon thee, confeſſing me, will I build my Church:</hi> So neither his Perſon alone, nor his Faith alone, but both conjoin'd make up this <hi>Rock. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> without Faith, had been unqualified for ſuch an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and Faith taken ſeparate, had been incongruous:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62666:67"/> For the Foundation, and the reſt of the Building ought to be Congenial. The Church is a Congregation of Men, as of Living Stones; ſo the Rock, which is the Foundation of the Church ought to be a Man ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſupported by Divine Aſſiſtance. <hi>Fundamentum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet cohaerere cum aedificio, ſicut caput cum membris; ſi fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum eſt ipſa fides, cum ſit res mere ſpiritualis, non conveniret cum Eccleſiâ, quae ex hominibus corpore ſenſa &amp; ratione conſtantibus conflatur.</hi> So I conclude, that as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is not the Foundation without Faith; ſo neither Faith taken ſolitarily, or reſiding in any other Subject than in him; but <hi>his Faith in and with his Perſon,</hi> as St. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> elegantly phraſes it on <hi>Peter,</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>firm as a Rock in Faith,</hi> or, <hi>Immobili inconcuſsâ firmitate ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dato in fide.</hi> It was obſerv'd by Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> that the Antient Fathers upon the <hi>Arians</hi> oppugning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of our Savior, finding no place in the Scripture more fit to manifeſt Chriſt to be the connatural Son of God, than this moſt noble Confeſſion of <hi>Peter,</hi> did much exalt its Dignity, but with no intention in the leaſt of denying the Church to be built on his Perſon, but look'd on this his Confeſſion to be the <hi>cauſal,</hi> and his Perſon to be the <hi>formal</hi> Foundation of the Church. Thus the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſometimes affirming <hi>Peters</hi> Faith to be the Rock, and ſometimes himſelf, are not contrary Expoſitions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding or extinguiſhing, but including one the other, they meaning hereby, the Church to be built <hi>cauſally</hi> on <hi>Peters</hi> Confeſſion, and <hi>formally</hi> on his Perſon, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion being the Motive which induc'd our Savior to build his Church on his Perſon: This do's approximate very nigh to <hi>Maldonat</hi>'s Senſe, <hi>Commodiſſima interpretatio mihi videtur, ſi dicamus eos dicere voluiſſe ſuper fidem &amp; confeſſionem</hi> Petri <hi>Eccleſiam aedificatam, id eſt, ſuper</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum <hi>propter fidem &amp; confeſſionem: hujuſmodi phraſibus</hi>

               <p>I ſhall next produce the Sayings of ſome Fathers, to prove the Church more eminently built on <hi>Peter,</hi> than on any of the other Apoſtles.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. to heal it, I repair'd to Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> who thus inform'd me, <hi>Cathedra</hi> Petri <hi>non ſucceſſionem Pontificum, ſed</hi> Petri <hi>fidem ſignificat.</hi> This appear'd to me to be a meer ſhuffle, for I knew that that Father did in his 57th Epiſt. to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus</hi> acknowledge him to poſſeſs both <hi>fidem &amp; ſedem</hi> Petri: From this Doctor I went to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting in his <hi>Rational Account</hi> to find ſomething that might be proportionate to that Title, but I found my ſelf likewiſe there defeated of my deſir'd ſatisfaction: His words were theſe, <hi>This Teſtimony ſeems big and high at firſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:62666:75"/> 
                  <hi>and I ſhall not impute theſe expreſſions, either to St.</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom<hi>'s heat, or flattery, altho' it looks the more ſuſpitious, becauſe at that time he had ſo great a pique againſt the Eaſtern Biſhops; and that thoſe words are contain'd in a complemental addreſs to</hi> Damaſus, <hi>becauſe looked on as a</hi> Roman <hi>Chriſtened in that Church, he addreſſes himſelf to</hi> Damaſus.</p>
               <p>Here the Doctor pretending not to aſcribe theſe words either to St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s heat or flattery, doth obliquely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringe him as guilty of both. As for the pique which he ſays <hi>Hierom</hi> had with the Eaſtern Biſhops; I queſtion whether the Doctor can prove he had any more diſguſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them than what might ariſe from their Errors and Schiſm; ſo he ſeeing their Contentions and Diviſions thought it the ſafeſt way to break off Communion with them, and apply himſelf to St. <hi>Peters</hi> See. Their Schiſm he declares in theſe words in the abovementioned Epiſtle, <hi>Quoniam vetuſto Oriens inter ſe populorum furore colliſus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciſſam Domini Tunicam &amp; deſuper textam minutatim per fruſta diſcerpit.</hi> After this he diſcovers the true Doctrin of the Weſtern, and the Errors of the Oriental Church; the former he affirms to have preſerv'd <hi>incorruptam Patrum haereditatem;</hi> and that they did return <hi>Dominici ſeminis puritatem centeno fructu;</hi> but that in the latter, the good Seed did degenerate in <hi>Lolium avenaſque:</hi> Then he ſays, <hi>In occidente Sol Juſtitiae; in oriente Lucifer: vos aurea vaſa; hic lignea, teſtacea:</hi> Theſe are high Encomiums of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; but now after all this, the main reaſon that oblig'd him to aſſociate himſelf in Communion with <hi>Damaſus</hi> was, becauſe he as Heir to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſat in his <hi>Cathedra,</hi> on which he acknowledg'd the Church to be built as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did confeſs the Succeſſion of Biſhops from <hi>Peter</hi> to be the invincible Rock) ſo here is neither flattery nor complement as the Doctor would fain ſhift it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62666:75"/> off with, it being very irrational to imagin, that that Great Father would make uſe of either in matters of Faith which concern'd his Souls Salvation. And if the Doctor has a faculty to deprave ſuch a plain place as this is, no paſſage in the Fathers will be able to reſiſt the cunning of ſuch contortions.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y enſuing Task will be to treat of the Keys, which I deſign here to do with as much brevity as the avoidance of obſcurity will permit. I prov'd in my Papers to you, that they, by a general acceptation, were Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols and Enſigns of Dominion: And moreover, that by a Scriptural Metaphor in <hi>Iſaias</hi> 22. they denoted Supreme, Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction. To my firſt Proof you are as ſilent as a Turkiſh Mute: My ſecond you oppugn. But before I write any thing in its defence, I muſt tell you, That whether or no our Savior did allude to thoſe words
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62666:80"/> in <hi>Iſaias,</hi> 'tis eaſie enough to make out, that he, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing them to <hi>Peter</hi> did deſtine him to the Supreme Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power without the aſſiſtance of an alluſion to this Paſſage: Yet 'tis highly probable, Chriſt did allude to them, and whoſoever doth ſedately poiſe theſe words <hi>Dabo Clavem domûs</hi> David, <hi>&amp; dabo tibi Claves;</hi> will find ſuch a ſtrict adjacency and alliance betwixt them, as with good reaſon he may imagin our Savior did allude to them. But to choak up the very Springs of this Cavil, I ſhall now prove the Keys even in the Senſe of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to decypher abſolute Dominion: and accordingly you will find St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his 55th <hi>Homil.</hi> on St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> to affirm, that our Savior, by vertue of his Promiſe of the donation of the Keys, did not only give St. <hi>Peter</hi> Power over the whole World, but to riſe a Key higher, even over things in Heaven. The Keys likewiſe in <hi>Apocalips</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. ſignifie Supreme Power, where our Savior ſays of himſelf, <hi>Habeo Claves mortis &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferni;</hi> By which Phraſe abſolute dominion over Death and Hell is indigitated; and St. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> affirms as much, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>; <hi>by the Key of Hell is ſignified, that Chriſt has power over Life and Death:</hi> In his Comments on <hi>Apoc. Cap.</hi> 8. and in the ſame place he ſays, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>, <hi>The Keys are enſigns of Power:</hi> And thus <hi>Oecomenius</hi> in his Comment on theſe words, <hi>Qui habet Clavem</hi> David, ſays, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>He calls Power by the name of a Key, for he that has Power of ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and opening, is entruſted with the Houſe; and this you may more clearly learn in the Goſpel, by thoſe words which Chriſt ſpake to</hi> Peter, Et dabo tibi Claves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a little

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The Keys import Power;</hi> and in this Senſe 'tis twice more us'd in that Book, as in <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Data eſt ei Clavis Putei &amp; Abyſſi;</hi> and <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Videt</hi> Johannes <hi>Angelum habentem Clavem Abyſſi:</hi> And accordingly it was antiently us'd in <hi>Orphicis,</hi>

               <p>Thus you may ſee I need not be beholden to that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in <hi>Iſaias</hi> to prove <hi>Peters</hi> Power granted him by the gift of the Keys; but becauſe I mention'd it as an Argument, I ſhall ſay a little in its defence, and make ſome Reply to your Objections. Firſt, you ſay, <hi>That it cannot be prov'd, that</hi> Sobna <hi>or</hi> Eliakim <hi>were of the Prieſts Order:</hi> To this I anſwer, that you cannot diſprove but that they were. This I am ſure of, that I have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority which avouches they were, than you have, that they were not. As for your Pretenſions to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Tongue, ſhould I grant them juſt, and permit you to paſs Muſter for a <hi>Rabbi;</hi> yet it do's not at all follow, that I ſhould be ſo conceited of you as to equalize you to St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> whoſe knowledge in that Language was ſo great, as all ought to veil to him. So I judge it my ſafeſt way not to exorbitate from his Tranſlation impreſs'd by the ſtamp of the Catholick Church. But to keep to the Point, the Hebrew word <hi>Sochen</hi> (which is no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty in that Language) is liable to different meanings. But I find St. <hi>Hierom</hi> to tranſlate <hi>Ingredere ad Sochen</hi> thus, <hi>Ingredere ad eum, qui habitat in Tabernaculo ad</hi> Sob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam <hi>Praepoſitum Templi,</hi> The <hi>Septuag.</hi> ſays thus, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <p>The next thing you affirm is, <hi>That by the Keys in that place, is not meant any Supreme Authority, either in Church or State, ſuch as the</hi> Romaniſt's <hi>claim for</hi> Peter <hi>and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, for</hi> Sobna <hi>and</hi> Eliakim, <hi>if Prieſts were ſubject to King</hi> Hezechias, <hi>and the Kings in thoſe Days, and many Ages after, were Supreme in all Cauſes, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil.</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62666:82"/> Civil, and to have govern'd Church Affairs, both <hi>de facto &amp; de jure)</hi> I find my ſelf oblig'd to make ſome Reply to it, as likewiſe, of Chriſtian Princes (to whom from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> you deſcend): But I would more willingly have declin'd treating of this Point, knowing how nice and dangerous it is to handle it; and that now I walk <hi>per ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſuppoſitos cineri doloſo:</hi> But becauſe you have ſo fairly thrown it in my way, and being treating of the Keys, it will ſeem fit to clear their Authority, I cannot well avoid taking ſome notice of it, which I ſhall here do, making a ſhort halt in taking up this <hi>Atalanta</hi>'s <hi>Apple,</hi> which you ſeem to have drop'd to impede my courſe. It may appear ſtrange that I, who am of the Laity, ſhould write in favor of the Clergy; and that you, who are a Divine ſhould endeavour to eſtabliſh Laicocephaliſm, and depreſs the Clergy, robbing it of its juſt Rights, and thereby becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſe to your own Coat: But if this be well inſpected, there is much to be ſaid in your Vindication; for you (knowing that your New Religion was begun, and hitherto maintain'd by the Secular Power) cannot but in gratitude and policy give it the preference; however, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in this preſent conjuncture, be willing to recal part of what you have ſo prodigally granted.</p>
               <p>The firſt you mention to have govern'd Church Affairs, both <hi>de facto &amp; de jure,</hi> is <hi>Moſes;</hi> and it is granted you, that he did ſo; but then you are to look on him as a mixt Perſon, in whom both the Sacerdotal and Regal Power were combin'd: So what he did herein, was not purely by virtue of his Kingly, but Prieſtly Power.

                  </gap>, <hi>Prince of Princes, and Prieſt of Prieſts.</hi> Now the Secular and Eccleſiaſtick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which was united in the Perſon of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards parted betwixt <hi>Eleazer</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the one ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding him in the Prieſtly, and the other in the Princely Power; as you may ſee in the 27th of <hi>Numbers,</hi> where God commands <hi>Moſes</hi> to give <hi>Joſhua</hi> part of his Glory; but in the ſame Chapt. you may ſee that he ſubjected <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Eleazer,</hi> at whoſe word, both he and all the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to go in and out.</p>
               <p>Your next Example is of <hi>Salomon,</hi> whom I grant to have remov'd <hi>Abiathar</hi> from the Pontificate, and to have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated <hi>Sadock</hi> in his place. But firſt you are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he was not depos'd for any matter of Faith, or concerning Religion; but for Treaſon and Rebellion: For conſpiring with <hi>Adonia</hi> (whom he had Anointed King) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Salomon.</hi> Next you are to obſerve, that <hi>Salomon</hi> exauctorated him not as King, but as Prophet, to whom God had committed ſome things after an extraordinary manner. So what he acted herein, was not by his own Royal Power, but by Authority and Commiſſion from God, by Divine Inſpiration, as the Text evidences, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t impleretur Sermo Dei quem locutus eſt ſuper domo</hi> Eli <hi>in</hi> Silo. This Action therefore of his, do's not at all prove him to be ſuperior to the High-Prieſt: But only that God was pleas'd to make uſe of him as an Executer for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of a Sentence which he had formerly denounc'd:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62666:83"/> And this will be eaſily underſtood if recourſe be made to Hiſtory. <hi>Aaron</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Eleazar</hi> and <hi>Ithamar: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazar</hi> as eldeſt ſucceeded him in the Prieſthood, his Son <hi>Phinees</hi> ſucceeded him, and his Poſterity down to <hi>Heli</hi> continued in that Holy Function. At which time the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Phinees</hi> incuriouſly adminiſtring the Prieſthood, God was pleas'd to puniſh their neglect, by tranſlating it from the Family of <hi>Eleazar</hi> to that of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> to wit, to <hi>Heli;</hi> in which Family it continued about 120 Years, to <hi>Salomons</hi> days, who depos'd <hi>Abiathar</hi> the<hi>—Abnepos</hi> of <hi>Heli,</hi> for conſpiring with his Corrival <hi>Adonias,</hi> ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Sadock</hi> in his place. Now as the Pontificate was remov'd by God's order from the Family of the eldeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to that of the younger Houſe, ſo was it likewiſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted from thence into the right Line, by the Authority of the ſame God, who was pleas'd in ſeveral things to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and direct thoſe Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> governing as it were by them. This made <hi>Joſephus</hi> to affirm in his Second Book againſt <hi>Appio,</hi> That God did not ſo much inſtitute in <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Monarchy as a <hi>Theocracy</hi> or <hi>Deiarchy:</hi> But now if this Action of <hi>Salomon</hi>'s depoſing <hi>Adonias,</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued in favor of the Prince, as if he thereby were Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the High-Prieſt, The Clergy has as ſtrong an Argument for their Superiority, in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s declaring King <hi>Saul</hi> dethron'd; but I look on both theſe Examples as extraordinary, and conſequently not Preſidential.</p>
               <p>The next Example is <hi>David,</hi> but he being likewiſe King and Prophet, what can be alledg'd concerning him, is anſwered in what is ſaid of <hi>Salomon;</hi> it is moreover mention'd of him, that what he did in Church Matters was, <hi>Juxta omnia quae ſcripta ſunt in Lege Domini.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Example of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> tho' it be granted he conſtituted Levites in the Houſe of God; yet in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book <hi>Paralip. Cap.</hi> 29. you may perceive, that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62666:83"/> what he did herein was, <hi>Secundum diſpoſitionem</hi> David <hi>&amp;</hi> Gad <hi>videntis, &amp;</hi> Nathan <hi>Prophetae. Siquidem Domini praeceptum fuit per manum Prophetarum ejus.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you will likewiſe find, that he was much ruled by <hi>Iſaias,</hi> as in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 48. 25. <hi>Fecit</hi> Ezechias <hi>quod placuit Deo, &amp; fortiter ivit in via</hi> David <hi>Patris ſui, quam man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit illi</hi> Iſaias. Thus you may perceive, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of theſe Kings are not at all appoſit to your Point, they not proving, that Princes by their ſole Royal Power may intermeddle in Church Affairs, or reform Religion in its Subſtance; enacting things by their own Authority, contrary to the Aſſent of Gods High-Prieſt and Prophets. Some Kings by extraordinary Command, as Kings and Prophets did concern themſelves in Church Affairs; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not without conſent and aſſiſtance of the Prieſts, did very laudably uſe their utmoſt power to deſtroy Idolatry, and reſtore Diſcipline; but which of them diſown'd the Authority of the High-Prieſt? abrogated his-Power, and inveſted himſelf with it? Now that the Kings of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were not Supreme in Church Matters, ſeems evident by the word of God ſpoken to the High-Prieſt <hi>Eliakim</hi> in <hi>Iſaias</hi> 22. where after he had promis'd to give him the Key of <hi>David,</hi> he explains to him the Power of it; <hi>Et aperiet &amp; non erit qui claudat, &amp; claudet, &amp; non erit qui aperiat;</hi> by which he plainly makes him Supreme in Church Affairs, no Perſon whatſoever being able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude whom he opened to; Or to introduce whom he ſhut out. And to Sinew this Argument with a ſtronger Nerve, you will find that <hi>Jehoſophat,</hi> who was a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince, would not handle Church Affairs, knowing that they belong'd to the High-Prieſt, as in <hi>Paralip.</hi> 2. 19. Ananias <hi>autem Sacerdos &amp; Pontifex veſter in his quae ad Deum pertinent praeſidebit.</hi> And on the contrary, <hi>Oſias,</hi> who preſum'd to uſurp the Sacerdotal Function, and offer
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62666:84"/> Incenſe to God, was by the <hi>incenſed</hi> Deity ſtruck with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy. By what I have mention'd it will clearly appear, how irrational it is for you to produce the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Kings as Examples to juſtifie your former Kings exorbitant tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Church Affairs, there being no Parallel at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them; They acting therein as Kings and Prophets Authoriz'd by Gods extraordinary Commiſſion, and in their Reformations joining with the High-Prieſt; whereas yours was in oppoſition to him, and warranted by nothing but Secular Might. But now after all this, if you could clearly prove, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Kings were ſuperior to the High-Prieſt, and Supreme <hi>(Quatenùs</hi> Kings) in Church Affairs; it would not follow, that that ſimilitude ſhould hold good amongſt Chriſtians; The Prieſthood in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> being Imperfect, Carnal, Umbratick, and Prefigurative, of one that was Compleat, Sublime and Spiritual. Hence St. <hi>Chryſoſt. Lib. de Sacerd.</hi> comparing the Prieſts of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> with thoſe of the <hi>New,</hi> aſcribes to them the cure of the Leproſie of the Body; but to theſe, the Power to cleanſe the filth and impurity of the Soul, <hi>they bring Fire; but theſe the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And in his <hi>Orat.</hi> 5. <hi>adver.

               <p>Your laſt Reaſon for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Kings Supremacy in Church Affairs, is, <hi>Becauſe by Divine appointment they were,</hi> Cuſtodes utriuſque Tabulae. This Argument ſeems to me very inſufficient for ſuch a Proof: For tho' the Book of the Law was by Gods Command given to the King, it was not that he ſhould expound the Senſe of it upon any emergent Controverſie; but it was given him to govern himſelf and his Subjects by it: That by the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62666:84"/> frequent reading of it, he might learn to fear God, and keep his Statutes; and that by his Laws and Temporal Sword, he ſhould defend the true Religion therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contain'd: As for the Interpretation of the Law that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the High-Prieſt, according to the inviolable Decree in <hi>Malachy</hi> 2. <hi>Labia Sacerdotis cuſtodient ſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, &amp; Legem requirent ex ore ejus:</hi> They were as <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> affirms in his Second Book againſt <hi>Appio.</hi>

Now whether the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> High-Prieſt were liable to Error as you aſſert, is not worth my preſent Diſcuſſion (no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick being bound to believe the Popes Infallibility, but in Conjunction with a Council;) But this is clear, the <hi>Jews</hi> were abſolutely oblig'd to ſubmit to his determinations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der penalty of Death, he having written on his <hi>Rationali DOCTRINA ET VERITAS.</hi> By this you may imagin how dangerous it would have been for any one in thoſe days to have affirm'd him Fallible, and upon that pretence to have oppoſed his Definitions.

               <p>YOur next Diſcourſe is about Chriſtian Princes, theſe you aſſert to be Heads of the Church; and your Reaſon for this Aſſertion is this, <hi>That if a King be Head of his Kingdom, he is Head of the Church, becauſe that is in his Kingdom.</hi> This I muſt acknowledge to be a very ſtrong Argument, to prove a <hi>Nero</hi> Head of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in its Infancy it was in his Dominions. But Card. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> will give you good information herein, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you how Chriſtian Kings are Heads of the Kingdom, and how they may be Supreme, <hi>Praeſunt Reges Chriſtiani hominibus, non ut Chriſtiani, ſed ut homines ſunt: Reges non ut Chriſtiani praeſunt, ſed ut homines politici,</hi> &amp;c. And again, <hi>Reges habent primum locum inter Chriſtianos, ut Chriſtiani ſunt homines; id eſt, Cives terrenae Civitatis: Non ut ſunt Cives Sanctorum, Domeſtici Dei, Eccleſiae membra.</hi> Hence you may ſee, that a King may be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in his Kingdom, and yet not be Head of the Church; thoſe two Eſtates reſiding in two ſeveral Perſons, as being of diſtinct and different Natures. The ones Dominion
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62666:85"/> extending to Mundan, Temporal, Corruptible things; the Body and Goods of Fortune; the other reaching to things Spiritual, Eternal, Celeſtial, to things appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another World, and Salvation of the Soul. And 'tis neceſſary to have two ſuch diſtinct Governors: The Civil Power to maintain Peace, to protect and ſecure us in our Temporals: The Eccleſiaſtick to teach us the true Worſhip of God, to feed us with Food that periſheth not, to direct us in Spirituals, to the attainment of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Bliſs. Theſe two Kingdoms conſiſting of things ſo widely diſtant one from the other, cannot be injurious or prejudicial to one another (or any way interfere but by way of abuſe) but rather aſſiſtant to one another, being in themſelves Friendly and Amicable. Hence <hi>Samuel</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving anointed <hi>David</hi> King, kiſſed him, the Kiſs being a Symbol of Peace and Amity: This was a Signature of the mutual Agreement, and Accord betwixt theſe two Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments; they are both Independent, ſo as one might not uſurp on the other, or hinder the other in the due Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their Charge. The Prince is abſolute in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of all Civil Matters, in which all Perſons in his Dominions are ſubject; and herein the King may be called <hi>Homo a Deo ſecundus, &amp; ſolo Deo minor,</hi> as <hi>Tertull.</hi> has it, <hi>ad Scapul;</hi> or as <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> ſays in <hi>Hom.</hi> 2. <hi>Antioch.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Prieſt on the other ſide preſides in Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in Spiritual Affairs, in Reſolutions of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in Faith, in Explications of Articles of Belief, in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the Prince is <hi>Caput Regale,</hi> and the Prieſt is <hi>Caput Sacerdotale.</hi> They are both of Divine Inſtitution: The Kingly Power communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Princes from Heaven, their Charter being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from God, by whom Kings Reign. The Prieſtly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62666:86"/> Juriſdiction originated from Chriſt, ſubſiſting in its own Nature without Subordination or dependency on the Temporal Power. Now to admit and ſubmit to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal Power, as Supreme in things meerly and purely Spiritual, do's not at all diſluſtre the Regal Sway, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the leaſt Particle from his Sovereign Juriſdiction, the former properly inſinuating it ſelf to the ſecret Cloſets of Spiritual Receſſes, where the Scepter of the Temporal Prince has no Dominion.</p>
               <p>Having premis'd thus much concerning the Kingly and Prieſtly Power, I ſhall make a ſhort Reply unto you about Chriſtian Princes, whom you affirm to have govern'd Church Affairs, both <hi>de facto &amp; de jure.</hi> Now that ſome of them did intermeddle with Church Affairs, is not deny'd, ſeveral of them being <hi>Arians;</hi> but that they did it <hi>de jure,</hi> will not be yielded you, neither could I ever learn how they ſhould come by this Right; for 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Chriſt committed the Care and Government of the Church and Church Affairs to his Apoſtles. Now if you can produce his Commiſſion for the transferring this Power from their Succeſſors into the Hands of Secular Princes, I ſhall herein be ſatisfied. This I am ſure of, that it continued in their Hands above 300 Years, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> being the firſt Chriſtian King; and 'tis evident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that he never attempted to rob them of it, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it to himſelf; and the other good Emperours would not intermeddle with Church-Affairs, but by aſſent of the Church, and to aſſiſt it: Some other Emperors that were buſie herein, ruin'd themſelves thereby, and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of it, as <hi>Conſtantius</hi> by name, who upon his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed declar'd this to be one of the three things that moſt diſquieted him, which <hi>Nazianz.</hi> mentions to be theſe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <p>As for the Emperors <hi>Juſtinian, Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Charlemain,</hi> whom you likewiſe particularize upon the ſame account as you did <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> I muſt acknowledge, that they did make Laws concerning the Affairs of the Church, but
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62666:88"/> none of them made any in oppoſition to it, or the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, but rather agreeable to them, reducing the Churches Faith and Canons for Diſcipline into Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Laws, to the intent they might be more obey'd by their Subjects. This is no more than what was practis'd by <hi>Jovinian,</hi> who in thoſe great differences of Opinions which were in his days, deſir'd of the Orthodox Biſhops a Platform of the True Faith, which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> gave him, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>, as <hi>Nazianz.</hi> calls it, <hi>A Royal Gift indeed,</hi> which he confirm'd by his Imperial Power. But to return to the above mention'd Emperors, and to ſee how their Examples will jump with your Caſe. Firſt, They made Laws, that the Catholick Religion ſhould be obſerv'd in all their Dominions: You make Laws for its ſubverſion, altering its Articles, and foiſting in their room <hi>new Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> in oppoſition to them. They made Laws in defence of the Pope, acknowledging him the Prince and Head of Gods Holy Prieſts: You make Laws in defiance of him, pulling of him down as a Spiritual Uſurper. They made Laws which were according to his Approbation, the Rules and Definitions of the Church, backing the Spiritual with the Temporal Sword: You make Laws in affront to him, and againſt the Decrees of the Church. Thus you ſee their proceedings herein have no affinity with <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Headſhip, nor with <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eccleſiaſtick Laws, nor with Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> New Articles and Canons.

               <p>As for <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> I find in <hi>Sozom.

I can find no Edict of his for reforming and altering it: This he enjoyn'd thoſe under him to be of, under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of being reputed Hereticks, and Infamous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of Puniſhment. Thus much Power in Church-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs is ſtill granted every King; and to ſpeak the Truth, 'tis their Duty to defend the Church by their Temporal Power againſt Hereſie and Schiſm: By ſuch Actions as theſe they purchaſe to themſelves the glorious Title of <hi>Nurſing Fathers</hi> and <hi>Propugnators,</hi> not by uſurping Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Church, depluming its Head of that Power which Chriſt inveſted him with, and appropriating it to themſelves, changing Articles of Belief eſtabliſh'd by General Councils, and Antient Traditionary Truths, handed down from Father to Son; theſe are Actions unpreſidented by any well inſtructed Chriſtian Emperor, who I find to be very cautious touching Church-Affairs, as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the Anſwer of the Emperor <hi>Valentinian</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>Heraclea, Sozom.

               <p>After this vagrancy of your Roving Fancy you begin to think of home, and being return'd into your own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, you affirm of our Engliſh Kings, that Church-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were both <hi>de facto &amp; jure,</hi> govern'd by them. This if you ſhall ever be able to prove out of good Authors, you will certainly deſerve the <hi>Palm</hi> for an admirable Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</p>
               <p>I have already prov'd, that Church-Matters do belong to the Spiritual not to the Temporal Power; and that theſe two Governments are diſtinct; and for this I have the Authority of St. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> who in his <hi>Hom.</hi> 4. <hi>de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> Iſaiae <hi>in Vidi Dominum,</hi> ſays, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>; <hi>There be other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of a Kingdom, and other limits of the Prieſthood, but this is greater than that.</hi> As for Matter of Fact, I will not deny but that ſome Princes before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth irritated, either by their Paſſion, or allur'd by a curioſity of intermedling with what did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to them, have intrench'd upon the Immunities of the Church, and aſſerting a pretended Right, have claſhed with the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop, and medled <hi>de facto</hi> with Church-Matters, but <hi>quo jure</hi> is the Queſtion. You cannot prove a right of Power by proving an exerciſe of Power, unleſs it be allow'd of for granted, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a King do's is lawful. Their Quarrels with the Pope were chiefly about Inveſtitures, and diſpoſal of Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks: They did not deny his Supremacy in Spirituals; or if they quarrelled with any particular Pope, they did not attempt the aboliſhing of Papacy. A Pope may be to blame, and ſo may a King; but neither of theſe Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as Sacred) ought to be abrogated for the faults of Men. But to bring the parrallel home to your Caſe: Did our Kings before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth make themſelves abſolute Heads of the Church immediately under Chriſt?
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62666:89"/> Did they challenge as innate to their Crowns, Supreme Power in all Caſes both Spiritual and Civil? Did they rob the Pope of his Power, and aſſume Papal Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Did they vendicate to themſelves Authority in Church Affairs, ordering Laymen, Vicar Generals in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualities, as <hi>Cromwell</hi> was, who ſat in the Convocation-Houſe amongſt the Biſhops, as Head over them? This would to them have appear'd as new and monſtrous a ſight as ever was brought out of <hi>Africa.</hi> Suppoſe they claſh'd with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> did they ever part from her, and all other Chriſtian Churches beſides, as you did in your Reformation? making Laws to reverſe Decrees of General Councils, changing Religion, and altering Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Belief? Did they pick Quarrels with the Church, and then Sacrilegiouſly ſeize on her Lands and Goods, Sacrificing to their fury as many Churchmen as would not comply with their Nefarious Oaths; Demoliſhing Religious Houſes, violating Sacred Orders? Was any thing of this nature acted in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, or of thoſe brave Princes before him? But I ſhall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further on this Point, we having at preſent a King granted us by the indulgent benignity of Heaven, who well knows, how to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Rights of the Church, and his own Royal Right; betwixt what belongs to, God and what to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> what to the <hi>Miter</hi> and what to the <hi>Crown.</hi> A moſt Religious Prince tracing the ſure Footſteps of his Great Anceſtors; owning the Religion which his vaſt Kingdoms receiv'd at their forſaking Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm, and Converſion to Chriſtianity.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62666:90"/> him amongſt Kings, the moſt Conſpicuous, amongſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs the moſt Renown'd; we ought to be highly grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Supreme God, whoſe Lieutenant he is; hoping that under ſo Gracious and Merciful a Prince we may be protected from our cruel inveterate Enemies, and that now at length our Innocency may be a ſufficient Shield to defend us from the falſe Oaths of Profligate, Perjur'd Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, who have ſo long triumph'd over us, bathing their wicked Hands in guiltleſs Blood. And now having made mention of our Natural Liege Sovereign, I ſhall conclude this Point with a Prayer for him, according to the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> wiſhing his Majeſty <hi>Vitam prolixam: Imperium ſecurum: Domum tutam: Exercitus fortes: Senatum fidelem: Populum probum: Orbem quietum:</hi> And I hope you will join with me herein, not formally, as when you pray for him in your Church, marring your Prayer with ſome oblique Reflection; but <hi>ex Pectore,</hi> Heartily wiſhing him all thoſe Benedictions which he may deſire as <hi>Homo,</hi> and as <hi>Caeſar; Which God grant him.</hi> Morever, I would deſire you to leave off injuring your Prince, in railing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Religion in your Sermons, falſly repreſenting it to your cheated Auditory, impreſſing them with wrong Ideas of it, and thereby alienating the Affections of his Majeſties Liege Subjects, which is a Crime of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt magnitude, and of moſt dangerous Conſequences; yet this freedom is taken by ſeveral, who fancy they may wreak and evaporate that Paſſion (which they dare not on his Sacred Perſon) ſafely againſt his Religion; thus ſlily diſcharging their rancour againſt a moſt incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Prince, to whom they can aſcribe no other fault, but what really in it ſelf is Glorious and deſerving Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, namely, <hi>His returning to the boſom of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church;</hi> which Action of his being render'd more noble by the violent Oppoſitions and Contraſts of his

               </head>
               <p>IT may now ſeem high time to finiſh my intermitted Diſcourſe concerning the Keys, anſwering you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in that Point: But upon peruſing your Papers, I find you write but little on this Subject, but only offer me a rude indigeſted Lump of Quotations, without any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which in lieu of becoming a Clue to conduct me, were a Skain of ſnarled Thred to perplex and involve me; which made me more curious in prying into the intricacies of this matter and of acquiring ſatisfaction herein, which I thought could not be obtain'd without reducing your Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations into ſome form, and then by ſolving them. Your chief drift in them was, I perceive, Firſt to prove that <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered for the reſt of the Apoſtles; and thence to infer,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62666:91"/> that what was ſaid by our Savior to him, was ſpoken to the Reſt: By this Method you would evince the Reſt to be equally concern'd with him in the donation of the Keys: This, in ſhort, is the Web of your Deſign, which I ſhall here endeavour to unravel. This kind of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting I find Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> to make uſe of long before you, Petrus <hi>Diſcipulorum omnium nomine reſpondit, Tu es Chriſtus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo omnium nomine audivit, Tibi da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo Claves;</hi> but the cunning of this reaſoning will be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detected, when it is examined upon what account he may be ſaid to anſwer for the Reſt.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62666:93"/> they had them in the ſame Senſe and Amplitude that <hi>Peter</hi> had: And herein I ſubmit to <hi>Janſenius,</hi> whoſe words are theſe, <hi>Quamvis dici poteſt ſicut Patres frequenter dicunt, etiam omnibus Apoſtolis traditas Claves, loquendo de Clavibus; ut per eas communiter ſignificatur poteſtas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittendi retinendique peccata; ſicut, ibi nulla Clavium mentio, ita non eſt neceſſe dicere Claves</hi> Petro <hi>promiſſas, omnibus traditas ſecundum eum ſenſum, quo</hi> Petro <hi>hic pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſae; non Apoſtolis ibi, aut alibi Claves ita traditae.</hi> Now if either, or both of theſe places you cite, were equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to <hi>Dabo tibi Claves,</hi> what Reaſon will you give why <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have both a particular, and general promiſe of them; and why he ſhould have two Promiſes of the ſame thing, whereas one had ſufficed. But, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I add, That whatſoever was meant by either of thoſe Texts, they being ſpoken conjointly to the Twelve, <hi>Peter</hi> had certainly as large a ſhare in them as any; but having (over and above his portion in this joint pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe) a particular one apart to himſelf, in which the Reſt were immediately no ſharers; it cannot be diſprov'd, but (by vertue of this ſingular, ſeparate Promiſe made to him perſonally, in the preſence of the Reſt) that he had the Keys either alone; or if the Power of the Keys were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards given to the Reſt, that he was Supreme in it; he having beſides the Power of Binding and Looſing, which is an effect of the Keys: The Keys themſelves, which are a Badge and Symbol of that Power.</p>
               <p>He then Originally receiv'd them as they are Enſigns of Supreme Eccleſiaſtick Power, Oeconomy and Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip in Chriſt's Houſe, which is the Church; and was thereby conſtituted his Steward, and ſet over all his Family. But notwithſtanding all this, I ſhall not here go about to appropriate the Power and Uſe of the Keys only to him; limiting them to his ſole peculiar en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62666:94"/> but ſhall grant you that they had the uſe of them; for <hi>Peter</hi> did not receive them ſo as to retain them ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to himſelf, but to communicate them to the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and following Paſtors, as <hi>Thomas contra Gentes</hi> affirms, <hi>Non ſic intelligitur,</hi> Petro <hi>Claves Regni com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſiſſe, ut ipſe ſolus haberet, ſed per eum derivarentur ad alios.</hi> And accordingly St. <hi>Leo, Tranſivit quidem in alios Apoſtolos vis poteſtatis hujus, &amp; ad omnes Eccleſiae Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes, decreti hujus conſtitutio commeavit.</hi> Having yielded you thus much, I ſhall here only maintain the Inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Inferiority, and ſubordination of this Power in the other Apoſtles, to an higher, ſublimer and compleater degree of it in <hi>Peter:</hi> They then may be ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Keys Secondarily, Derivatively, Participatively, by their Aſſociating, Adhering, and Communicating with him their Head and Prince, to whom after a particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing manner, they were originally given to indigitate his Plenitude and Sovereignty in them.</p>

In this their Apoſtolick Commiſſion, they were all equal; but this was granted them not in reference to one another, but in relation to the whole World, of which they were all Princes and Heads, whereas <hi>Dabo tibi Claves</hi> was ſpoken to <hi>Peter,</hi> apart, after a particular manner, not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the other, with a particular Bleſſing, ſprung from a particular Act of his confeſſing Chriſt his Divinity, Chriſt alluding to his Name, and declaring to him his Fathers Name, and this was done in the preſence of the Reſt, to ſhew them he deſign'd him their Head and Prince.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s being call'd</hi> Satan: <hi>And of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT will not now ſeem incongruous to ſay ſomething of Chriſts calling St. <hi>Peter Satan,</hi> not long after he had told him that he would build his Church on him, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62666:99"/> had promis'd him the Keys: For this I find objected by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, as if by calling him ſo, Chriſt had evacuated what he promis'd him before. But it is to be conſider'd, that this happen'd betwixt the time of the Promiſe and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance which was not exhibited till after Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> on his Comments on <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. ſeems with this ſolution to ſatisfie the Objection, <hi>Prudens lector inquirat quomodo poſt tantam beatitudinem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nunc audiat. Vade retro me Satana; aut quae ſit tam repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina converſio, ut poſt tanta praemia Satanas appelletur. Sed ſi conſideret qui hoc quaerit,</hi> Petro <hi>illam beatitudinem, pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem, &amp; aedificationem ſuper eum Eccleſiae in futuro pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſam, non in praeſenti datam intelliget, Aedificabo, inquit, ſuper te Eccleſiam meam, &amp; Portae Inferi non praevalebunt adverſus eam, &amp; dabo tibi Claves Regni Coelorum, omnia de futuro, quae ſi ſtatim dediſſet ei, nunquam in eo pravae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſionis error inveniſſet locum.</hi> And accordingly <hi>Theophyl.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>The word</hi> Dabo <hi>ſignifies the time to come, to wit, after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> But if that for which he is check'd be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, you will find two things which much extenuate his fault; the one is his great Love and Tenderneſs to Chriſt, declar'd in theſe words, <hi>Propitius eſto tibi Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne;</hi> the other is his ignorance of Chriſts deſign in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the World. Now he is called <hi>Satan,</hi> not as if he willingly or malitiouſly did go about to hinder the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mankind, but becauſe he out of ignorance of Gods Eternal Decree, gave Chriſt that Advice of favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, which had it been follow'd, would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed our Redemption which was deſign'd us by the Bloody Sacrifice of the Croſs. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> on his 49th Tract. <hi>Johan.</hi> do's acquit him of any Crime herein, <hi>Nec</hi> Petro <hi>tamen humana ignorantia proficit ad crimen, non enim ei Pater adhuc omne paſſionis Myſterium revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verat,</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:62666:99"/> 
                  <hi>voluerunt conſilium dare Domino, ne moriretur qui ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat mori, ne ipſi morerentur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing of this nature which I ſhall inſiſt on, is, his Denyal, which by ſeveral is highly exaggerated, as if all his Dignities had thereby been forfeited and loſt; but in this his fault, it is likewiſe to be conſider'd, that it was committed before his inſtallment in his Supreme Power, which was not ſolemniz'd till Chriſt return'd Victorious from the Grave. It was before he was <hi>virtute indutus ex alto;</hi> it was before he had receiv'd the Holy Ghoſt by Chriſts Inſufflation, <hi>Timore</hi> Petrus <hi>ter negavit, nondum enim acceperat Spiritum Sanctum; accepto poſtea Spiritu Sancto cum fiduciâ caepit praedicare; qui ad vocem ancillae ter negaverat, accepto Spiritu Sancto inter flagella Principum confeſſus eſt quem negaverat,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Ambroſe, Pſal.</hi> 90.</p>
               <p>The Fathers alledge ſeveral Reaſons why God permitted this Great Apoſtle to commit this Offence. The firſt is, that he might be propos'd to us as a pattern not to deſpair when we fall into any Sin; this is <hi>Theophyl.</hi> Senſe of it on <hi>Luke</hi> 22. The Second is, That he might be a happy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample unto us of not perſevering in our Sins, but by a ſpeedy Repentance to lament, deteſt and forſake them. The Third is mention'd by St. <hi>Auſtin, Ideo B.</hi> Petrum <hi>paululum ſubdeſeruit, ut in illo totum humanum genus poſſet agnoſcere nihil ſe ſine gratiâ Dei praevalere.</hi> But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and adequate Reaſon is, becauſe Chriſt deſigning him to be the Supreme Ruler of the Church, whom he did purpoſe to entruſt with the Keys (by which he gave him full Power to abſolve or retain Sins) that he might be compaſſionate and favourable to poor Penitent Sinners in abſolving them, as Chriſt had mercifully forgiven him. And this is clearly St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Senſe of it in <hi>Serm.</hi> 124. <hi>de Temp. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Eccleſiae Rectori futuro ignoſcendi peccatoribus</hi>

                  <hi>quaedam regula poneretur:</hi> And in the ſame place, <hi>Divinae Providentiae ſecretum ita temperavit atque permiſit, ut pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ipſe laberetur ac rueret in peccatum, quo ergo peccantes duriorem ſententiam proprii caſus intuitu temperaret.</hi> For <hi>Peter</hi> was thought to be by nature very ſevere and rigid; and leſt he ſhould be too ſtrict a Cenſor of Human Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, God ſuffered him to fall into this Sin, that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on his own Offence he might be more gentle and indulgent to other Tranſgreſſors, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t in Clavibus eſſet fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delis Janitor, in ſententiis clementiſſimus Diſpenſator; erat enim reverâ</hi> Petrus <hi>paulo durior &amp; ſeverus,</hi> ſays the ſame Author. This is likewiſe St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Opinion of it, <hi>in</hi> Petrum <hi>&amp;</hi> Eliam, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Sin, that he, as being without Sin might not be rigid and averſe to pardon: He who was entruſted with the Church, the Pillar of the Churches, the Haven of Faith, even</hi> Peter <hi>the Maſter of the World, was ſuffered to treſpaſs, that this Man's being permitted to Sin, might become an Argument of favor to others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his <hi>Serm.</hi> 124. <hi>de Temp.</hi> is pleas'd to call this a ſmall fault in him, <hi>Exiguae culpae permittitur ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacere tantus Apoſtolus,</hi> &amp;c. Not but that the Offence was foul enough, but becauſe it was of ſo ſhort a continuance, he immediately recovering himſelf by a ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It was a ſhort Eclipſe, a Trip, rather than a Fall; a Verbal, rather than a Real; a Labial, rather than a Mental Abnegation, <hi>In Domini paſſione titubat</hi> Petrus <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone non Mente.</hi> His Tongue had no ſooner diſown'd him, but his Heart proteſting againſt it, proclaim'd him with penitential Tears, <hi>Voce viſus eſt denegare, lachrymis</hi>

Now if the Carriage of the other Diſciples be well inſpected, I much queſtion whether they will be found in this juncture truer to our Savior than he: For if he did deny him, and <hi>Judas</hi> did betray him, how honourably the reſt did behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Theophyl.</hi> will tell you, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The reſt fled for't:</hi> And this Action of theirs was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a diſowning of him, but a ſign of a fearful, diſtruſtful temper. <hi>Peter</hi> only of the Diſciples had the Heart to follow him, and expoſe himſelf to danger. St. <hi>John</hi> did indeed accompany him, but this was not out of pure Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor and Gallantry as <hi>Peter</hi> did, for St. <hi>John</hi> run no Riſchie herein, he relying on the High Prieſts acquaintance for his ſafeguard and protection: And this was well obſerv'd by <hi>Theophyl.</hi> who ſays, he did not follow Chriſt as (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62666:103"/> to his Paſtoral Care and Regency; who by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of theſe our Saviors words was created, not only chief Paſtor of all other Chriſtians, but even of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves. He then only had Commiſſion to feed the whole Flock of Chriſt, taken in a Collective Senſe, as comprehending all Chriſtians, and likewiſe the Apoſtles themſelves; as I ſhall hereafter Illuſtrate.</p>
               <p>Your following Attempt to leſſen <hi>Peters</hi> Power is, by aſſaying to take his Commiſſion from him; affirming <hi>Paſce Oves meas to be an Exhortation and no Commiſſion.</hi> This Artifice I find to be made uſe of by ſeveral Modern Proteſtant Authors. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſays, <hi>All that can by any torture be extracted from it, is an Exhortation to a diligent diſcharge of that Office to which he was before Commiſſion'd.</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 7. <hi>Thoſe words contain no particular Commiſſion to</hi> Peter, <hi>but a more vehement Exhortation to the diſcharge of his Duty.</hi> Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Supremacy, <hi>Theſe words are not Inſtitutive or Collative of Power, but rather only Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitive, Exhortative to Duty.</hi> Thus they agree in their united Verdict: But the words being pronounc'd by a Lord to his Servant, Imperatively, have no Lineaments of an Exhortation, but of a Commiſſion: And accordingly I find the Fathers (whoſe Senſe I rather chooſe to follow, than ſuch Authors) to Interpret them; looking on them as a <hi>Command, Commiſſion, Injunction; as a great truſt committed to him,</hi> as will clearly appear by the following Quotations, <hi>Mandatum de paſcendis Ovibus ſuis unum idemque ter praecepit.

               <p>Thus you may ſee by the joint ſuffrages of the Fathers, that it was a <hi>Truſt, Mandate,</hi> or <hi>Commiſſion</hi> which was given to <hi>Peter</hi> after Dinner, it being cuſtomary with our Savior to do great things after Meals, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>Res magnas poſt Prandium aut Coenam fecit Chriſtus.</hi> After Supper he inſtituted the B. Euchariſt; and now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eaten ſome broil'd Fiſh with his Diſciples, being mindful of the Promiſe he had made to <hi>Peter</hi> of building his Church on him, here he performs it, creating him Supreme Head and Paſtor of his Church, Conſtituting the Church-Government Monarchical. And 'tis obſervable, that as in the Promiſe he calls <hi>Peter, Simon Barjona;</hi> ſo here in the Performance he calls him <hi>Simon Jona,</hi> to ſhew that the Performance was made to the ſame Identical Perſon to whom it was promis'd. The Promiſe was uſhered in by an Interrogatory, ſo was the Performance; the Promiſe was made upon his egregious Faith, ſurpaſſing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62666:104"/> that of the Reſt; the Performance was exhibited upon his extraordinary Love, ſurmounting that of the Reſt. As for the other Apoſtles, they before this, had their War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Authority conſign'd them when our Savior breath'd on them, Commiſſionating them, ſaying, <hi>Sicut miſit me Pater,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Euntes, Docete omnes Nationes,</hi> &amp;c. This was their unlimited Commiſſion, whereas the firſt was confin'd to the loſt Sheep of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being excepted: This was the General Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given in Common to the Apoſtolick Colledge, in which every Apoſtle had an equal ſhare. Now <hi>Peter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and above the proportion he had in this Grant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Power he had jointly with the Reſt, receives an Authority proper and peculiar to himſelf, Chriſt ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſomething apart to him above the Reſt for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Faith, and prefulgency of his Love; the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end of which Action was to preſerve Unity, not only in Church-Government, but likewiſe in Faith. <hi>Quamvis Apoſtolis omnibus poſt Reſurrectionem ſüam parem tribuat poteſtatem,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Cyprian, ſicut miſit me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ut unitatem manifeſtaret, unam Cathedram conſtituit, &amp; unitatis ejuſdem originem ab uno incipiente ſuâ authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te diſpoſuit.</hi> I ſhall conclude this Point with a Saying of <hi>Janſenius, Cum primâ apparitione Apoſtolis parem contulit poteſtatem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nunc ad tollendum Schiſma &amp; ut Eccleſia una monſtretur, unus omnibus praeficitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now after all this, you ſay 'tis a ſign it was an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, becauſe, Peter <hi>was ſorry for its Tergemination, which he would not have been at the receipt of a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> This your Reaſon ſeems to me very pleaſant and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertive; I perceive you would have had him very debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nair at this his Inveſtiture, as you would be upon obtaining a Fat and Unctious Benefice. But firſt, I muſt tell you, he had little Reaſon to be very chearly; for Chriſt had
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62666:104"/> no ſooner given him his Commiſſion, but he allay'd his Joy by foretelling him his Crucifixion. But I find you to be guilty of a wide miſtake concerning the Original of his Sorrow, which I conceive to be deriv'd from Springs very diſtant from your Apprehenſions of it; for Petrus <hi>mirabatur &amp; cum quodam taedio audiebat quoerentem, quem nover at omnia ſcientem,</hi> Auguſt. de Temp. 149. Serm. <hi>Contriſtatus eſt quod ſaepe interrogatus eſt ab eo qui ſciret quod interrogabat,</hi> Serm. 50. in Evang. Johan. And again, <hi>Contriſtatus eſt</hi> Petrus <hi>quod eum tertio interrogat, quaſi ille qui vidit conſcientiam negationis, non videbat fidem confiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> gloſſes much to the ſame effect, Petrus <hi>doluit quia interrogatus eſt, Amas me?

And on the laſt Chapter of <hi>Luke</hi> he ſays, <hi>Contriſtatur</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus <hi>quia tertio interrogatur, Amas me? is enim interrogatur de quo dubitatur.</hi> And on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. <hi>enarrat. Taedio affectus</hi> Petrus, <hi>quaſi dubitaret Dominus noſter de amore ejus:</hi> This may ſuffice to ſatisfie you concerning the true Reaſon of his ſorrow.</p>
               <p>One thing I ſhall add more on this matter, and that is, concerning Dr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> who affirms, the words <hi>Paſce O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves meas,</hi> to be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

And to make this fully underſtood, I will ſuppoſe ſome Favourite of a Prince, who had a place at Court, through ſome miſdemeanor incurring his Maſters Diſpleaſure to loſe it, and after the decurrence of ſome time, to be ſo happy as by regaining his Princes Favor to be promoted to a higher Office than before: This Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite

               </p>
               <p>The laſt thing you take notice of on this Matter, is, That I ſaid <hi>Paſce Oves meas</hi> was ſpoken to <hi>Peter</hi> thrice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his trine Negation; but you ſuppoſe I will not ſay he merited it for his threefold denial: This ſuppoſition of yours might very well have been omitted as unneceſſary; and I may very well wave it, as undeſerving any notice ſhould be taken of it; what I ſaid was this, <hi>That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior asked</hi> Peter <hi>thrice, ſuitable to his trine denial (as St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>obſerv'd,</hi> Additur trinae negationi trina confeſſio) <hi>whether he lov'd him,</hi> &amp;c.

This is all you quote; but upon examining the place out of which theſe words were taken, I find the foregoing words to be theſe, <hi>Non ſine cauſâ inter omnes Apoſtolos hujus Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae Catholicae perſonam ſuſtinet</hi> Petrus, <hi>huic enim Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae Claves Regni Caelorum datae ſunt, cum</hi> Petro <hi>datae ſunt; &amp; cum ei dicitur, omnibus dicitur, Paſce Oves meas;</hi> Auguſt. <hi>de Agone Chriſtianâ.</hi> Here you are to underſtand, that in his Judgment <hi>Peter</hi> only of all the Apoſtles perſonated the Catholick Church, and that the Keys are ſaid to be given to her when they were given to him; namely, as to its <hi>Head, Primate</hi> and <hi>Rector,</hi> as I have already prov'd out of his Writings: In this only Senſe I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62666:106"/> fully prov'd, that thoſe words which were original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immediately ſpoken to <hi>Peter</hi> are ſaid to be ſpoken to the Reſt, they being all Epitomiz'd and compriz'd in him as their Chief: In this Acceptation I grant, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſce Oves meas,</hi> might be ſpoken to all the Diſciples, and in no other aſpect. Now this do's not at all hinder, but that theſe words were ſpoken primordially to <hi>Peter</hi> ſolely; and this is acknowledg'd by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, in his Book <hi>de Paſtoribus,</hi> where ſpeaking of our Savior, <hi>Tunc ideo commendavit Oves, quia invenit</hi> Petrum; <hi>imo vero in ipſo</hi> Petro <hi>unitatem commendavit; multi erant Apoſtoli, &amp; uni dicitur, Paſce Oves meas.</hi> And again in the ſame Book, Petro <hi>dixerat, Paſce Oves meas: quid ergo facie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus? Cum</hi> Petro <hi>commendantur Oves; non ibi dixit Dominus, Ego paſcam Oves meas, non tu, ſed</hi> Petre, <hi>Amas me? Paſce Oves meas.</hi> And again, <hi>Sic certe a Domino ad Beatum</hi> Petrum <hi>dicitur,</hi> Petre, <hi>Amas me? &amp; ille, tu ſcis, Domine, quia amo te. Et cum tertio fuiſſet interrogatus, &amp; trinâ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſione fuiſſet ſubſecutus, repetitum eſt a Domino tertiò, Paſce Oves meas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your following attempt is to prove thoſe words to be ſpoken to all Paſtors as well as to <hi>Peter,</hi> by your Saying cited out of St. <hi>Baſil, Conſequenter omnibus Paſtoribus dictum eſt,</hi> &amp;c. But this your Quotation do's you no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at all, it amounting to no more than what I frankly grant; for I do, as well as you, believe the words to be conſequently derivatively, extenſively ſpoken to every <hi>Paſtor,</hi> all being Figured and Repreſented in the Supreme Paſtor St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> avouches, <hi>in feſto</hi> Petri <hi>&amp;</hi> Pauli. <hi>In uno</hi> Petro <hi>figurabatur unitas omnium Paſtorum, ſed bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> Now the moſt inferior Paſtor is as really one as a Biſhop, tho' his Sheep be not ſo numerous, nor his Fold ſo large; and I grant, that theſe words were in a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſecondary Senſe, ſpoken not only to the other Apoſtles,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62666:106"/> but to all lawful Paſtors; for <hi>Peter,</hi> tho' he were the Chief, was not the Sole Paſtor, <hi>Paſtor bonus Chriſtus, quid</hi> Petrus? <hi>Nonne Paſtor bonus? Quid</hi> Paulus, <hi>quid caeteri Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoli, quid Beati Epiſcopi, Martyres, quid Sanctus</hi> Cyprianus? <hi>nonne omnes Paſtores boni, non mercenarii?</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in his 50th <hi>Serm. Evang. Johan.</hi> Neither did he feed the Flock alone, but had the Apoſtles his Coadjutors, and Compresbyters, whom he exhorts to feed the Flock, not the Univerſal, but the Particular one, <hi>Paſcite gregem qui in vobis,</hi> the Prerogative of feeding the Univerſal Church, including both the Apoſtles and other Chriſtians, being delegated to <hi>Peter</hi> only, as Supreme Paſtor of the Church; I therefore affirm, that the words were princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, immediately, and initially ſpoken to him alone; but I acknowledge likewiſe, that in a Proportion'd Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Senſe, <hi>In quodam Modo,</hi> they ſuit and quadrate with all true Paſtors: For as <hi>Salmeron</hi> affirms, <hi>Quod ſummo Paſtori dicitur, id ſuo modo &amp; proportione ſervatâ, aliis minoribus Paſtoribus dictum eſt;</hi> Becauſe they who are called as Fellow-Labourers into part of the Paſtoral Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Solicitude, are to exſcribe and imitate the Form that <hi>Peter</hi> uſed in Feeding, Loving, Cheriſhing, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending his Flock.

               <p>BUT beſides the Authority of theſe Fathers, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text highly favours my Opinion, perſpicuouſly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing theſe words originally to be ſpoken to <hi>Peter</hi> only, and my Argument runs thus, To him only it was reply'd <hi>Paſce Oves meas,</hi> who was ask'd, <hi>Diligis me plus his?</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi> only was ask'd that Queſtion; therefore the Reply was directed to him ſolely, the other Apoſtles being moſt viſibly ſecluded and ſhut out by the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Plus his:</hi> But beſides this, the following Diſcourſe 'twixt our Savior and him, further illuſtrates this with a Meridian Ray; he only being ſaid to be Contriſtated; to him only Crucifixion was foretold; to him only it was ſaid Thou, when thou groweſt Old, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if this be not a ſufficient <hi>Mercuries Rod</hi> to chaſe away your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; Do but weigh in juſt Ballances the Reaſon why our Savior ſaid theſe words to him, and you will find it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant to Reaſon to admit the other Apoſtles equally with him concern'd in them. For if Chriſt had deſign'd
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62666:108"/> him to be no more a Paſtor than any of the Reſt by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of theſe words, the Queſtion had been more rationally ſtated thus, Simon Jona, <hi>do you love me as much as any of the other do?</hi> But our Savior asking him, whether he lov'd him more than the Reſt, did by the ſhape and frame of the Queſtion intend him a particular Superiority above the Reſt: He then loving Chriſt more than they, had a larger Commiſſion, a more diffus'd Authority, a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Juriſdiction and Grant to feed Chriſts Sheep more than they had. This is <hi>Maldonatus</hi> Senſe of it, <hi>Hic Chriſtus a</hi> Petro <hi>ſingulare quiddam requirit, quod caeteri non habent; aliquid ergo viciſſim illi dare vult proprium &amp; ſingulare, quo caeteris antecederet.</hi> This ſeems to me moſt ſerenely to be the Native and Genuine meaning of our Saviors Queſtion, diſarray'd of all Heretical Deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, otherwiſe I deſire to know, to what purpoſe and deſignment was the Interrogation of a greater degree of love; why not of an equal portion, if the Reward were to be equal? Now that this his egregious Love, was the Motive that induc'd Chriſt to grant him this Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that it was a neceſſary and eſſential qualification for the obtainment of it, ſeems clear, and the words may be Paraphras'd thus, If you do love me more than theſe, feed my Sheep, if you do not, I will not have you feed them. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Modeſty would not permit him to ſay, that he did love Chriſt more than the Reſt; but he did ſubmiſſively appeal to our Saviors unerring Judgment, who knew the ſecret Receſſes and Affections both of his, and of the Hearts of the Reſt. Chriſt by Commanding him to feed his Sheep, did declare him the Greateſt Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. This Explication of the place is facil, natural, and openly lies upon the Surface of the words, and is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Senſe of the Fathers.</p>

But I, in the mean time, moſt Bleſſed Saint, will pray to thee to pray for me, <hi>Sancte</hi> Petre, <hi>Ora pro nobis:</hi> And thus I conclude my Firſt Book of your Supremacy, moſt humbly begging, that if I have wrote any thing worthy of your Approbation, you would be pleas'd to accept of it as flowing from a Heart devoted to your Honor, pardoning the imperfect Characters of a Pen vanquiſh'd by the Greatneſs of ſo Sublime a Subject.</p>
